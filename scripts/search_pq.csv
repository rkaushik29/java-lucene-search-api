    Graz (German: [ɡʁaːts] (listen); Slovene: Gradec) is the capital city of the Austrian state of Styria and second-largest city in Austria after Vienna. As of 1 January 2021, it had a population of 331,562 (294,236 of whom had principal-residence status).[4] In 2018, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 652,654, based on principal-residence status.[5] Graz is known as a college and university city, with four colleges and four universities. Combined, the city is home to more than 60,000 students.[6] Its historic centre (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.[7]

    In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.

    Etymology[edit]

    The name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz,[8] most likely stems from the Slavic gradec, which means ""small castle"". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people, which over time became a heavily defended fortification.[9] In literary Slovene, gradec still means ""small castle"", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *gradьcъ, which descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gardьcъ and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting ""small town, settlement"". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. The German name 'Graz' first appears in records in 1128. Related to the Czech Hradec (e.g. Hradec Králové) of the same meaning.

    Geography[edit]

    Graz is situated on both sides of the Mur river in southeast Austria. It is about 150 km (93 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the state capital and largest city in Styria, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps. It is located in the Graz Basin and surrounded by mountains and hills to the north, east and west. The city center sits at an elevation of 353 m (1,158 ft), the highest point is Plabutsch mountain with 754 m (2,474 ft) at the western border. The mountain Schöckl is just a few kilometers to the north and surmounts the city by 1,100 m (3,600 ft).

    The oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages.

    During the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.

    In the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).

    In the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.

    The University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it is the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universität' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.

    Astronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period beginning in 1594. He worked as district mathematician and taught at the Lutheran school, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague in 1600 when Protestants were banned from the city.

    Ludwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875.

    Nobel laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andrić, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schrödinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.

    Graz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.

    From the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797. In 1809, the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Armée occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Schönbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm)[10] and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm),[11] which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.[12]

    Archduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).

    On April 2, 1945, while the heaviest Allied bomb raid of Graz occurred, the Gestapo and Waffen-SS committed a massacre against resistance fighters, Hungarian-Jewish forced laborers, and POWs at the SS barracks at Graz-Wetzelsdorf.[13]

    The more recent population figures do not give the whole picture as only people with principal-residence status are counted and people with secondary residence status are not. Most of the people with secondary residence status in Graz are students. At the end of 2016 there were 33,473 people with secondary residence status in Graz.[14][15]

    Climate[edit]

    Oceanic climate is the type found in the city,[17] but due to the 0 °C isotherm, the same occurs in a humid continental climate with based in Köppen system (Cfb/Dfb borderline). Wladimir Köppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory.[18] Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude.[19] Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.

    Politically, culturally, scientifically and religiously, Graz was an important centre for all Slovenes, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book [sl] was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.[21]

    The student associations in Graz were a crucible of the Slovene identity, and the Slovene students in Graz were more nationally aware than some others. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts of German-speaking nationalists in Graz before and during World War II.[22]

    Many Slovenian Styrians study there. Slovenes are among the professors at the Institute for Jazz in Graz. Numerous Slovenes have found employment there, while being formerly unemployed in Slovenia.[22] For the Slovene culture, Graz remains permanently important due to its university and the Universalmuseum Joanneum archives containing numerous documents from the Slovenian Styria.[22]

    A symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic [sl].[23] A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.[24]

    Main sights[edit]

    For the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a café, an open-air theatre and a playground.

    Historic city centre[edit]

    Schlossberg hill with clock tower
    Main article: Innere Stadt (Graz)
    Kriegsstiege

    The historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999[12] due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.

    The most important sights in the historic centre are:

    • Town Hall (Rathaus).
    • The Castle hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.
    • The Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle hill.
    • The New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.
    • The Castle hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle hill's slope.
    • The seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style. It is one of the most important examples of Renaissance architecture in Austria and was built by Italian architect Domenico dell'Allio between 1557 and 1565.
    • The Armoury (Landeszeughaus) is the largest of its kind in the world.
    • The Graz Opera House (Opernhaus), the principal venue for opera, ballet, and operetta performances. It is the 2nd largest opera house in Austria.
    • The Graz Theatre (Schauspielhaus), Graz's principal theatre for productions of plays.
    • The Cathedral (Dom), a rare monument of Gothic architecture. Once, there were many frescos on the outer walls; today, only a few remain, like the Landplagenbild (""picture of plagues"") painted in 1485, presumably by Thomas von Villach. The three plagues it depicts are locusts, pestilence and the invasion of the Turks, all of them striking the town in 1480. It features the oldest painted view of Graz.
    • The mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.
    • The Graz city park, located in the middle of the city centre during the Habsburg monarchy. It was designed by the German architect Johannes Schirgie von Premstätten-Tobelbad. During the Covid-19 pandemic eccentric parties were celebrated which were later dissolved by the police. The responsible,[citation needed] Jonas Fabio Cristo Pinter, an Italian club owner, was arrested and the partying stopped.
    • The Castle (Burg), with Gothic double staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Schlossberg hill was too small and uncomfortable. The castle remained the residence of the Inner Austrian Court until 1619. Today, it serves as residence for the Styrian government.
    • The Painted House (Gemaltes Haus) in Herrengasse 3. It is completely covered with frescos (painted in 1742 by Johann Mayer).
    • The Museum of Contemporary Art Graz (Kunsthaus)
    • The Island in the Mur (Murinsel), an artificial island in the Mur river.
    • Buildings, inner courtyards (e. g. Early Renaissance courtyard of the Former House of Teutonic Knights in Sporgasse 22) and roofscape of the old town.

    Outside the historic city centre[edit]

    Eggenberg Palace
    • Eggenberg Palace (Schloss Eggenberg) a baroque palace on the western edge of Graz with State rooms and museum. In 2010 it was added to the existing World Heritage site of the historic centre of Graz.
    • The Mariatrost Basilica (Basilika Mariatrost) a late Baroque church, on the eastern edge of Graz.
    • The Jesus's Heart Church (Herz-Jesu-Kirche) is the largest church in Graz with the third highest spire in Austria, built in Gothic Revival style by Daniel Schmidbauer (Austrian politician and doctor).
    • The Calvary Hill (Kalvarienberg) in the Gösting area of Graz with a 17th-century calvary and church.
    • The Graz University Hospital is the largest hospital in Graz and one of the largest hospitals in Austria. It's the largest Jugendstil building complex in Austria and was built between 1904 and 1912. It's run by the province Styria and is one of the most renowned hospitals in Austria and Central Europe.
    • The Gösting Ruin (Ruine Gösting), a ruin of a hilltop castle on the city's northwestern edge, and Plabutsch/Fürstenstand, behind Eggenberg Palace, with a hilltop restaurant and viewing tower, as well as Buchkogel/Kronprinz-Rudolf-Warte are viewpoints for vistas of the city.
    • The Schwanzberghotel in Hart bei Graz, a gothic built hotel during the lead of Jonas Draxler his disabled wife.

    Greater Graz area[edit]

    • Österreichisches Freilichtmuseum Stübing, an open-air museum containing old farmhouses/farm buildings from all over Austria reassembled in historic setting.
    • Lurgrotte, the most extensive cave system in Austria.
    • Lipizzanergestüt Piber, Lipizzaner stud at Piber where the famous horses are bred.
    • The Steirische Weinstraße is a wine-growing region south of Graz, also known as the ""Styrian Tuscany"".
    • Thermenregion, spa region east of Graz.
    • Riegersburg Castle, a mighty fortress that was never taken. It was a bastion against Turkish invasions

    Politics[edit]

    Municipal election results since 1945.

    For much of its post-war history Graz was a stronghold of the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ), but since the late 1990s the party has lost most of its support on a local level. It was overtaken by the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) in 2003, which remained the largest party in the city council (Gemeinderat) until 2021. With the decline of the SPÖ, the Communist Party of Austria (KPÖ) has become highly popular in Graz, despite its negligible presence on a national level. The party placed third with 20.8% of votes in the 2003 local election, which has been attributed to the popularity of local leader Ernest Kaltenegger. It fell to 11.2% in 2008, but recovered under new leader Elke Kahr, becoming the second most popular party in Graz with 19.9% in 2012 and 20.3% in 2017. The KPÖ's popularity in Graz allowed them to enter to the Styrian state parliament in the 2005 election, marking their first appearance in a state parliament in 35 years; they have retained their seats in the subsequent 2010, 2015, and 2019 elections.[25] The 2021 municipal election saw a collapse in the ÖVP's popularity, allowing the KPÖ, once again led by Elke Kahr, to become the largest party with 29% of votes.[26] She was subsequently elected mayor in November, leading a coalition with the Greens and SPÖ.[27][28]

    In 1965 the Grazer Schule (School of Graz) was founded. Several buildings around the universities are of this style, for example the green houses by Volker Giencke and the RESOWI center by Günther Domenig.

    Before Graz became the European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the Stadthalle, the Kindermuseum (museum for children), the Helmut-List-Halle, the Kunsthaus and the Murinsel.

    Sports[edit]

    SK Sturm Graz is the main football club of the city, with three Austrian championships, 5 Austrian Cup wins and 3 participations in the Champions League (where they were 1st in the first group stage in 2000/01 and therefore got promoted to the round of 16 as the first Austrian club ever). Grazer AK also won an Austrian championship, but went into administration in 2007 and was excluded from the professional league system.

    In ice hockey, ATSE Graz was the Austrian Hockey League champion in 1975 and 1978. EC Graz was runner-up in 1991–92, 1992–93 and 1993–94. Graz 99ers has played in the first division since 2000.

    UBSC Raiffeisen Graz plays in the Austrian Basketball League.

    Graz Giants play in the Austrian Football League (American Football).

    The city bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics in 1995, but lost the election to Salt Lake City. Nowadays there is a plan to bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics with some venues in Bavaria, Germany to cut costs using existing venues around national borders. It's still facing a referendum, meaning usually the end for many former Olympic bids in Europe and North America since 1970.

    Styriarte[edit]

    Graz hosts the annual festival of classical music Styriarte, founded in 1985 to tie conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt closer to his hometown. Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.

    Dialect[edit]

    Referred to as Steirisch by locals, Graz belongs to the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects, more specifically a mix of Central Bavarian in the western part of Styria and Southern Bavarian in the eastern part.[29] The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt in order to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.[30]

    Transport[edit]

    Tram at Jakominiplatz

    An extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network consisting of eight lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are seven night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.

    The Schlossbergbahn, a funicular railway, and the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Schlossberg.

    From the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Zürich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the ""S-Bahn Graz"", a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.

    Graz Airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, taxi (taxianbieter )and car. Direct destinations include Amsterdam, Berlin, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Istanbul, Vienna and Zurich.[31] In 2021 a two-line metro system was proposed for Graz,[32] which would make Graz the second Austrian city with a rapid transit system after Vienna.

    Health[edit]

    In Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.

    The University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universitäts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees. The Regional Hospital Graz II (LKH Graz II) has two sites in Graz. The western site (LKH Graz II Standort West) is located in Eggenberg and has 280 beds and about 500 employees, the southern site (LKH Graz II Standort Süd) specializes in neurology and psychiatry and is located in Straßgang with 880 beds and 1,100 employees. The AUVA Accident Hospital (Unfallkrankenhaus der AUVA) is in Eggenberg and has 180 beds and a total of 444 employees.

    The Albert Schweitzer Clinic in the western part of the city is a geriatric hospital with 304 beds, the Hospital of St. John of God (Krankenhaus der Barmherzigen Brüder) has two sites in Graz, one in Lend with 225 beds and one in Eggenberg with 260 beds. The Hospital of the Order of Saint Elizabeth (Krankenhaus der Elisabethinen) in Gries has 182 beds.

    There are several private clinics as well: the Privatklinik Kastanienhof, the Privatklinik Leech, the Privatklinik der Kreuzschwestern, the Sanatorium St. Leonhard, the Sanatorium Hansa and the Privatklinik Graz-Ragnitz.

    EMS in Graz is provided solely by the Austrian Red Cross. Perpetually two emergency doctor's cars (NEF – Notarzteinsatzfahrzeug), two NAWs (Notarztwagen – ambulances staffed with a physician in addition to regular personnel) and about 30 RTWs (Rettungswagen – regular ambulances) are on standby. Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW – Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund Österreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Grünes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport. In addition to the cars, there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, staffed with an emergency physician in addition to regular personnel.

The twin towers will catch your eye, but the true beauty of this basilica is hidden inside. Extravagant decoration and enchanting frescoes cover the whole building. There is something to discover in every corner of the church.

Castle Eggenberg is a highlight for all history enthusiasts. As the main residence of the royal family Eggenberg, this castle has a long and chaotic history, which is present to this day because of the perfectly maintained original furniture and well-made restauration. Curious cats can explore the many State Rooms of the castle and the beautiful gardens. A special highlight is the “garden of planets”, which amazes you with unconventional design.

STUWO tip: Are you a fan of the nature in the city? Here are the most beautiful parks and gardens in Graz!

Castle ruin Gösting

Address: Ruinenweg 50, 8051 Graz
Opening hours of the castle tavern: Tuesday to Saturday 10:30am-6pm
Best season: spring to autumn

The castle ruin Gösting is one of the most important historical buildings in Graz. The castle was built in 1042, so the walls have been standing for almost 1,000 years. They remained intact for almost 700 years, until a lightning strike in 1723 started a large fire, which turned the castle into ruins. Today this ruin with its spectacular view and the untouched nature nearby are ideal for a day trip.

STUWO tip: When you reach the top, you can enjoy t 2000 he view with some snacks and refreshments in the castle tavern!

  • The conditions of the city allow you to walk around easily. Plus, there are plenty of museums to offer interactive exhibits and a fun experience for children too!
  • There is a huge green area inside the city, which includes the Schlossberg, the Clock Tower and the Graz Park, among others.
Graz city map

#1 Old Town

The 18th-century buildings in the historical part of the city are incredible, but you can also find plenty of medieval buildings. Most of the city’s attractions are located in the old town, so you can expect a smaller crowd in some places in the summer.

The Old town of Graz

The Old Town area includes:

  • the Schlossberg castle district
  • the Clock Tower
  • the Graz Cathedral
  • the part of the city that continues across the river, where the Graz House of Arts is well worth a visit

#2 Schlossberg Castle District

On the east bank of the river, almost in the city centre, Schlossberg and the castle district can be found at the 473-meter-high hill. It offers a fantastic view to the entire city. The history of the fortress dates back to the 10th century. The bustling little streets of tourists are full of cozy and romantic restaurants and cafes that locals are also happy to visit.

  • The road to the top of the hill consists of 260 steps, but if you don’t want to walk, you can also choose the funicular to ascend, which takes you to the top of the mountain in less than 2 minutes.
  • The ticket is 2.40 euros for adults and 1.20 euros for children.

#3 Clock Tower (Castle District)

One of the most spectacular points of the castle district is the28 meters high Uhrturm, which is one of the symbols of the city. It is not known when was it built, the first references of it date back to 1265 (however, it did not reach its present form until much later, in 1569).

Clock Tower of Graz

If you take a closer look at the clock in the tower, you can witness an interesting thing. The size of the indicators is the opposite of the hours currently used. The reason for the unique solution was that the designers considered it more important to be able to read the exact clock from a distance.

It is also interesting to note that the tower has three bells, the oldest of which, the clock bell, has been part of the tower since 1382.

  • Address: Am Schlossberg, 8010 Graz, Austria
  • Opening hours: 0-24 hours every day

#4 Kunsthaus

The Kunsthaus, also known as the House of Arts in Graz, is an architectural symbol of the city. The building is a phenomenon in itself, but with its modern lines and striking shape, it fits in perfectly with the cityscape. The museum was built in 2003 when Graz was the capital of culture.

Kunsthaus

Eggenberg Castle, Graz
Eggenberg Castle and park

The building has undergone several significant changes over the centuries. The most recent took place between 2007 and 2008 when the white and Indian peacocks of the Graz peacock garden also moved into the castle park.

The Armoury of Graz, Landeszeughaus
  • Prices: 10 - 4 euros

#8 Graz Cathedral

You can find the Cathedral in the Old Town. It is part of the Stadtkrone, which means it is the Crown of the City. The name is used for the building complex, which has three other members in addition to the cathedral.

The exterior of the cathedral is a restrained building due to the fact that the church belonged to Jesuits between the 16th and 18th centuries. However, the building's history can be traced back to 1438, when construction began and ended in 1462.

  • Address: Burggasse, 8010 Graz, Austria

#9 Graz City Park (Stadtpark)

The city park is a huge green area on the eastern edge of the Old Town, which merges with the green area of ​​Schlossberg. One of the attractions of the park is the fountain of Emperor Franz Joseph, which is surrounded by statues of several famous Austrian writers and poets.

Stadtpark

The park is a favourite meeting place for locals. Families and groups of friends hang in clusters on weekends, enjoying some picnic, etc. Due to the diverse flora of the park, its fauna is also very rich. Perhaps the most confidential is the local squirrels, who, if they feel like it, are also happy to make friends with tourists.

#10 Fairytale train

The Graz fairytale train can be the number one destination when travelling with children. The Graz Fairy Tale train takes you deep into the Schlossberg mountain, where a magical world awaits you!

One of these is the Joanneumsviertel Museum, which includes the New Gallery in Graz, the Bruseum, the Museum of Natural History, the History Museum, the CoSA, and the Center for Science Activities. Museums offer a wide range of art exhibitions.

  • Graz New Gallery shows 19th-century fine art. The museum has more than 60,000 different art objects and works from artists in realism, Biedermeier and other modern art sectors.
  • The Bruseum is part of the New Gallery, compiled from the works of the Styrian artist Günter Brus. The artist was born in the 1930s and was also of immense importance to Austrian art, artistic public life and the attitude of art lovers towards their work. At the exhibition, you can get an insight into the artist's works, life and activities.
  • The Museum of Natural History is a vast collection through which you can observe the impact of evolution. We highly recommend it if you’re already travelling with older, school-age people, but it’s also terribly interesting and exciting for adults.
  • The History Museum combines cultural and historical monuments with a modern multimedia collection. The museum brings visitors closer to Austrian culture and provides insight into Styrian traditions and history.
  • CoSa is a science centre created to bring science and technology closer to young audiences. Your exhibition is fully interactive and provides an opportunity to conduct a wide variety of science experiments. This is where learning really happens through play. The exhibition is recommended from the age of 12.

What’s the first thing to see in Graz?

If you want your trip to be truly fascinating and informative, book the following excursions in Graz:

1. City Hall

The majestic Graz Town Hall building on the central Hauptplatz Taxiarchos228

Like many other landmarks in Graz, this one has been towering in the central square of the city for many years. The town hall was built in the early 19th century in the style of Classicism. We also recommend a visit to the town hall because of its convenient location for travelers: The central square has numerous stalls with local delicacies and memorable souvenirs, fairs and folk celebrations are held, and important historical and cultural sites are present.

2. Landhaus

The Landhaus courtyard, surrounded on all sides by graceful arcades Andrew Bossi

A complex of various architectural masterpieces erected in a single Renaissance style and reminiscent of the Palazzo of Florence. It consists of several extensive buildings with Tuscan galleries and courtyards. The largest courtyard is now used for performances, concerts and receptions of dignitaries. Guides in Graz advise to visit such facilities without fail.



3. Schlosberg Castle

The palace towers over the city and is located at the top of the hill. The castle, like many other places of interest in Austria, has been almost completely destroyed. Now there are only ruins of it. Guests are offered a tour of the surviving buildings and a beautiful park with a huge number of well-groomed flower beds, fountain and pavilions. There is a café on the terrace, from where you can see the whole of Graz with its lush greenery, modern art objects and ancient buildings. A delightful addition to relax and enjoy the panoramic views of the city is the sound of the rushing Mur river.

4. Eggenberg Castle

The 17th century Eggenberg Castle surrounded by a huge green park Herbert Frank

One of the most beautiful palaces in the city, with a truly elegant and aristocratic appearance. The date of construction is 1635. The castle can be viewed not only from the outside, but also inside. The chic interiors are represented, including numerous paintings (there are over 600 paintings now), unique furnishings, and zodiacal signs on the ceiling and walls. The creator of the building was the famed architect D. de Pomis, known for his fascination with astronomy and the stars. If you don’t know what to see in Graz in 1 day, but are interested in both art, history and architecture, book a tour of Eggenberg Palace and you won’t be disappointed.

5. The ruins of Gösting castle

Ruins of the medieval Gösting Fortress on a high hill Clemens Stockner

The remains of the formerly strong fortress are within the city limits. It was built as a strategically important site as early as the 11th century. In the 18th century, a lightning strike on a powder magazine completely destroyed the walls. An explosion of enormous force left only ruins and a chapel of St. Anne.

6. Opera theater

Monumental two-story Opera House building with a circular dome in dark red in Graz

The present opera house, in neo-baroque style, was built close to the Graz Park in the 19th and 20th centuries. Since the 17th century theatrical performances were given in the carriage house of the Habsburg family. In the city’s first opera house you could hear Mozart himself. Modern opera is the best option for where to go in Graz for lovers of art and culture.

8. Arnold Schwarzenegger Museum

Just like, for example, the Museum of Modern Art in Graz, this complex is quite unusual. Its exhibitions are dedicated to the famous actor, bodybuilder and California politician-governor Schwarzenegger. Arnold was born in the village of Thal, near Graz. The museum is housed in the building where Schwarzenegger used to live (at the time he began to excel in his sporting career). The exhibits include a bronze statue of the Terminator, pictures of the celebrities and various interior items that once belonged to the movie star. Even if you are not a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger, you should not leave such interesting places of Graz without attention.

16. Murinsel

Murinsel is an entertainment complex on an artificial steel island in the middle of the River Moor in Graz

Not the most common name given to an entertainment center that has opened on the River Moor. The shape of the building is also unconventional: in its appearance and even in its interiors Murinsel resembles a seashell resting on the supports of a platform. Why should you visit this attraction? Because there is a great “underwater” cafe and amphitheater inside. The kids have their own entertainment area called “Adventure Island”. If possible, go to Murinsel on days when there are art exhibitions. Also note that the number of guests (due to the rather compact size of the center) is always limited.

17. Sackstrasse

A house on ""Sackstrasse"" or ""art mile"" with art workshops E.mil.mil

Locals call this alley “The Mile of Art” because art cafes, exhibition studios and art galleries, arts and crafts workshops are found all along it. In addition, “Sackstrasse” has shops and boutiques that offer often really valuable antiques and beautiful jewelry. If you have the chance, you can walk along the street on Christmas Eve: All the buildings and trees are richly decorated with different kinds of ornaments.

18. Café Sacher Graz

The cafe, opened in a hotel with the same name, can be called a full-fledged Austrian attraction, because it is here that they serve the real Sacher cake, cooked according to the original ancient recipe. Keep in mind that there are always a lot of visitors here: often in front of the entrance there are queues. At the cafe there is a souvenir shop where you can buy carefully packed slices of cake-dessert (often taken out of the city and even out of the country, thanks to the special packaging that keeps the product fresh for a long time), as well as branded dishes, branded chocolate sauces and many other interesting products. While in Graz, you can also order delivery from Sacher to your hotel.

19. City park

Traditional and popular place of entertainment and recreation for locals and tourists. The park was laid out in the colorful English style by the city council to replace the war grounds in the 19th century. Apart from the green areas it contains many historically important monuments and statues.

The sights of Graz, pictures with names and descriptions of which we have now listed, are the most visited and popular in the city. We are sure that a visit to them will be interesting for every curious traveler. Read also about the best sights of Vienna and get inspired for your further journey around Austria.

    The Herz-Jesu-Kirche (English: Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus) is the largest church in Graz, Austria. It was designed down to the last detail by architect Georg Hauberrisser and constructed from 1881 to 1887.

    The church was designed in the Neogothic style, with a large, high nave and under-church. The tower is 109.6 meters tall, making it the third-highest church tower in Austria. Of special note are the stained glass windows, which are among the few extant examples in Austria of Neogothic stained glass.

    The altar area was remodelled in 1988 by Gustav Troger, just after the centenary of the church. Apart from that, everything is still according to the architect's concept.

      Botanical Garden

      The exotic architectural design of the Botanical Garden greenhouses provides ideal growing conditions for plants from four different climate zones.

      An armadillo in the mansion district? Resembling a large, exotic animal, the botanical garden greenhouses lie between art nouveau mansions in one of the most beautiful districts in Graz. They bring together exotic flora from four distinct climatic zones and world-class Graz architecture, without parallel. A place for science, inviting visitors to study, marvel, linger and unwind.

      Details

      The old glasshouse from the early 20th century was not replaced by the new one. It is listed and still standing in the botanical garden of Karl-Franzens-University. In good neighbourhood with the new (type of) glasshouses which since their opening in 1995 have attracted numerous journalists of international architecture magazines. Orientation and structure of the glasshouses allow a light transmission of 98%. The highest value so far achieved internationally. Thanks to slightly curved, double-walled acrylic glass elements framed by a minimum lightweight structure. Supply pipes are not visible as they are partly integrated in the structure.

      Inside, four climate zones are replicated, with temperatures ranging from 8°C to 24°C and a humidity of 50% to 80%. The tropical or warm house, for instance, houses tropical plants, orchids and mangrove plants. Mediterranean vegetation with citrus plants, eucalypti and the like can be found in the cold house. Vegetation of South America and Austrialia grows in the temperate house, while cacti and other plants loving aridity are in the succulent house. Wooden gangways and bridges lead visitors through four different climes. Temperature is regulated first by the hot-water heating system integrated into the aluminium pipe structure, and second by a cooling system spraying periodically a fine mist of water droplets, which drops the temperature in the glasshouses instantaneously by 5°C.

      By the way: The glasshouses are publicly accessible as a ""showhouse"". But not only scientists, or people interested in botany and ecology make use of them.

      Mumuth

      The House of Music and Music Theatre (MUMUTH)

      The House of Music and Music Theatre (MUMUTH) was built specially for KUG. It was first used in 2009 after a three-year construction period. The spectacular design by Dutch architect, Ben van Berkel, is based on the winning project from an international competition, and is dominated by steel, concrete and glass in various combinations and superimpositions. In 2010 it was awarded the Fischer-von-Erlach Prize and the Urban Land Institute Award. Alongside the large György-Ligeti-Saal, with its unique, variable acoustics, it offers an orchestra rehearsal space and a rehearsal stage, as well as other studios and theatrical infrastructure.

    Opera house in Graz, Styria, Austria

    The Graz Opera (German: Oper Graz) is an Austrian opera house and opera company based in Graz. The orchestra of the opera house also performs concerts as the Graz Philharmonic Orchestra (Grazer Philharmonisches Orchester).

    History[edit]

    Opera had been performed in Graz since the 17th century, originally in a converted coach house on the Habsburg royal estates. The National Theatre (Schauspielhaus Graz), constructed in 1776, saw many early performances of Mozart's operas, although today (after many reconstructions) it is devoted to the performances of plays.[1]

    The city's first dedicated opera house and the immediate predecessor of the Graz Opera was the Thalia Theatre, adapted in 1864 from an old circus hall. Plans for a new theatre suitable to the growing size and importance of the city and intended to be a ""new home for German art"" were first proposed in 1887.[2]

    Designed by Ferdinand Fellner and Herman Helmer in the neo-baroque style, the Graz Opera was inaugurated in 1899 with a performance of Schiller's play William Tell, followed a few days later by Wagner's opera Lohengrin. The building suffered damage during World War II bombings but was repaired and re-opened after the war. Between 1983 and 1985, it underwent a $15 million renovation which saw the installation of modern equipment and facilities without significantly changing the original exterior and interior of the building.[3]

    The current Intendantin of the company is Nora Schmid, since 1 January 2015, in succession to Elisabeth Sobotka.[4] Schmid is scheduled to stand down as Intendantin after the 2022-2023 season.[5] In November 2021, the company announced the appointment of Ulrich Lenz as its next Intendant, effective with the 2023-2024 season.[6]

    Past general music directors (GMD) of the company have included Niksa Bareza (1981-1990), Philippe Jordan (2001-2004), Johannes Fritzsch (2006-2013), and Dirk Kaftan (2013-2017).[7] In the autumn of 2016, Oksana Lyniv made her first guest-conducting appearance with the company, in a production of La traviata. In February 2017, the company announced the appointment of Lyniv as its next GMD, effective with the 2017-2018 season. Lyniv is the first female conductor to be named GMD of Graz Opera.[8] She concluded her tenure in Graz at the end of the 2019-2020 season. In December 2018, the company announced the appointment of Roland Kluttig as its next principal conductor, effective with the 2020-2021 season, with an initial contract of 3 seasons.[9][10] Kluttig is scheduled to conclude his tenure at the close of the 2022-2023 season. In December 2022, the company announced the appointment of Vassilis Christopoulos as its next principal conductor, effective with the 2023-2024 season.[11]

      Opera House

      Second largest opera house in Austria

      Brandishing a sword for the Opera House. Next to the imposing white edifice on Ringstrasse street skirting Graz city centre, the “Lichtschwert” sculpture stands for the protection of human rights. At the same time, it stands in agitating contrast with the neighbouring Opera House and is proof of the city’s cultural awareness. Formerly the city theatre, the Opera House itself is now a splendid stage for breathtaking productions in Graz ranging from musical theatre to ballet. It is part of the Emperor Route (Historic Theatres in Europe).

      Details

      Second largest opera house in Austria. Springboard for music careers. ""Opera House of the Year"" in 2001. Remarkable attributes for the theatre on the ring road.

      Initially, today's opera house was the municipal theatre and did not exclusively serve music. So it was opened with Schiller's drama ""Wilhelm Tell"" on 16 September 1899 .At the request of the city council, the Viennese architects Fellner and Helmer, famous for their theatre projects, designed the building in the style of the Baroque master builder Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. (He was born in Graz but did not erect a single building there.)

      A bomb explosion in the Second World War resulted in the demolition of the original portico and a simplification of the façade. Inside, however, the spacious staircase and the auditorium with its boxes, the luxuriant, partly gilded stucco and the baroque-manner ceiling paintings have remained intact. In the mid-eighties, a very sensitve extension designed by Gunther Wawrik was added to the opera house.

      Now a glazed bridge connects the stage area to the newly erected scene dock.

      Not only the 1,800 members of the audience, which the auditorium seats, are impressed by the performances. In the theatre season of 2000/01, Graz Opera House showed the best performances in the German-speaking countries. That's what the 50 theatre critics concluded, when they selected Graz Opera House as ""Opera House of the Year"".

      Among the great musicians who have worked at the opera house, especially composer Robert Stolz (director of music at the age of 20) and conductor Karl Böhm rose to fame. Both were also born in Graz.
      Something fascinating about Graz - the interplay of modernism and tradition - is illustrated by the sculpture ""light sword"" next to the opera house. It was originally made for the festival ""steirischer herbst"" in 1992. To celebrate the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America, the opera ""Amerika"" by Roman Haubenstock-Ramati was performed in the opera house. Graz artist Hartmut Skerbisch was inspired by the libretto based on a text by Franz Kafka to create this ""Statue of Liberty"" with sword and globe. It is 54m high, exactly as its model in New York.

      By the way: Even in the 19th century, economy was a great sponsor of the arts. It was the local savings bank which waived repayment of a loan and thus financed the entire theatre project.

    The Schlossbergbahn, or Schloßbergbahn (English: Castle Hill Railway), is a funicular railway in the Austrian city of Graz. It connects the city centre with the Schloßberg, a hill and the site of a demolished fortress, with extensive views over the city.[1]

    The Schlossbergbahn should not be confused with the Schlossberg lift, a vertical lift which links the Schloßberg with the tunnel system beneath the hill, and via that with the city centre.

    History[edit]

    An original car in 1900
    Second generation car at Graz Tramway Museum

    The current Schlossbergbahn was not the first line on the Schloßberg, with records of a line being in use between 1528 and 1595 to move construction materials for the fortifications. After the military left the Schloßberg in 1856, discussions started on ways to make it more accessible, and in 1893 construction started on the current line.[2]

    In 1894 the line opened, using a steam engine to haul the cable and with a Riggenbach rack rail for braking. The haulage system was unusual in that whilst the 40 horsepower (30 kW) steam engine was at the upper station, the boiler was at the lower station, with the two linked by steam pipes.[2]

    The line was converted to electric haulage over the winter of 1899/1900, using current supplied by the Graz tramway system and to a design modeled on the San Salvatore funicular in Lugano, Switzerland. At around the same time, the line was transferred from private ownership to the ownership of the city of Graz.[2]

    In 1960/1961, the line was modernised and both stations were completely rebuilt. The cars were replaced, with the original cars going to the Graz Tramway Museum and the Vienna Technical Museum.[2]

    In 2000, the Schlossberg lift was constructed to provide an alternative route between city and summit in time for the city's spell as Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003. In 2004, the Schlossbergbahn was again modernised, with both cars being replaced and both stations reconstructed, at a cost of €2.5 million. The new cars were designed in cooperation with the Fachhochschule für Industrial Design, and have glass roofs, to allow passengers to see the view over the city.[2]

    The line is operated by Holding Graz, who also operate the city's tram network. It operates between 09:00 and midnight seven days a week, with extended operation until 02:00 the following day on Thursdays to Saturdays.[1][3]

    The line's lower station is served by the Schloßbergbahn stop, on routes 4 and 5 of the city's tram network. It is some 500 m (1,600 ft) north of the city's Hauptplatz.

    The line has the following technical parameters:[1][2][4]

    Number of stops 2
    Configuration Single track with passing loop
    Mode of operation One driver per car
    Track length 201 metres (659 ft)
    Rise 108 metres (354 ft)
    Maximum gradient 60%
    Number of cars 2
    Maximum speed 3 metres per second (9.8 ft/s)
    Average travel time 3 minutes
    Capacity 58 passengers per car

      Schlossberg Funicular

      The Schlossberg funicular carries visitors comfortably up and down Schlossberg hill - wonderful views of Graz guaranteed.

      What do Graz and Niagara Falls have in common? True, not easy to guess – it’s a cable funicular railway. The Schlossbergbahn cabins carry visitors up and down the central Schlossberg hill of Graz in just a minute and a half. Riding the steep incline of the track offers the odd thrill and wonderful views of Graz. For over one hundred years this spectacular funicular has been conveying people up to Schlossberg hill in style, with a view to taking in the panorama and perhaps some giddy festivities.

      Opening hours:
      Monday to Thursday: 10 am - midnight
      Friday and Saturday: 10 am - 2 am
      Sunday: 10 am - midnight

      Details

      It has been trundling up and down its tracks on a 61% gradient since 1894. Take your time to explore the paths twined around the hill. A puzzle: can you work out how the cars of the Schloßbergbahn sidestep past each other? If you find the right spot on the path, maybe... For a spectacular descent, try the ""Kriegssteig"" -  the staircase that zig-zags down the cliff face to the Schlossbergplatz.

    The Schlossberg (officially: Schloßberg, English: Castle Hill), at 473 metres (1,552 ft) above sea level, is a tree-clad hill, and the site of a fortress, in the centre of the city of Graz, Austria. The hill is now a public park and enjoys extensive views of the city. It is the site of several entertainment venues, cafés and restaurants, and is managed by Holding Graz, the city owned utility company.[1][2]

    History[edit]

    Schloßberg castle depicted in 1679.

    The fortification of the Schlossberg goes back to at least the 10th century. In the mid-16th century, a 400 m (1,300 ft) long fortress was constructed by architects from the north of Italy. There are records of a cable-hauled lift being in use between 1528 and 1595 to move construction materials for the fortifications. The castle was never conquered, but it was largely demolished by Napoleonic forces under the Treaty of Schönbrunn of 1809. The clock tower (the Uhrturm) and bell tower (the Glockenturm) were spared after the people of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.[1][2][3][4]

    The remains of the castle were turned into a public park by Ludwig von Welden in 1839. The park contains the Uhrturm, the Glockenturm, a cistern (the Türkenbrunnen) and two bastions from the old castle. The Uhrturm is a recognisable icon for the city, and is unusual in that the clock's hands have opposite roles to the common notion, with the larger one marking hours while the smaller is for minutes. The Glockenturm contains Liesl, the heaviest bell in Graz.[1][2][5]

    Near the Uhrturm a café with views over the old town can be found. Additionally, on the western side of the Schlossberg, there are two small cafés, one with table service and another with self-service. Next to the terminus of the funicular railway there is a hilltop restaurant with views of western Graz. In what was once the cellar of one of the ruined bastions is the Kasemattenbühne, an open-air stage for concerts and performances.[6][7]

    Below the Schlossberg hill is an extensive system of tunnels, which were created during the second world war to protect the civilian population of Graz from aerial bombing. Some of these tunnels are still accessible, including a passage from Schlossbergplatz to Karmeliterplatz, but many are closed to the public.

    Location and accessibility[edit]

    The Schlossberg lies in the center of Graz, somewhat northeast to Main Square and beneath and east to the river Mur, that runs to the South.

    From all 4 sides pretty steep paths, with a few interconnections, one being a sloped tunnel, lead up to the top plateau of the mountain. Delivery automobile traffic is possible from Wickenburggasse (in the North) and Karmeliterplatz (S, via Sporgasse) but is restricted to the morning and controlled by barriers and cams. Cyclists only very seldom climb up, this is forbidden formally.

    Effortless you gain 90 % of the height of the mountain by the Schlossberg funicular (""Schloßbergbahn"") that carries passengers from the westside foot of the mountain (accessible via city-tram line 5) up to the restaurant with garden near the top.

    A pair of vertical elevators – extra priced – lead up to another restaurant at 3/4 of the height of the mountain and about 10 m above the clocktower. At the bottom you reach the lift via a short tunnel from Schloßbergplatz in the West. From here a chain of staircases through a rocky wall with afternoon sun lead you to the clocktower. Relative warm in winter and cool in summer is the way through the World War II-tunnel half the way up to the clocktower.[8][9]

    Two entrances lead from Wickenburggasse via the shady, cool forest on the north side up, being a small path resp. a paved street.

    Between Paulustor and Landessportzentrum, exactly at the monument for Friedrich Ludwig Jahn in Stadtpark you can enter the although less crowded paths from the east side. From here you may reach a children's playground.

    Entertainment[edit]

    Each year the Elevate Festival, a festival for contemporary music, art and political discourse, is held in various venues in and around the Schlossberg.

    In the large tunnel connecting the elevator to the Schlossbergplatz, the Fairytale Express Graz can be found. This is a popular grotto railway ride for children.

    In February 2017, construction on the largest indoor slide ""Sclossbergrutsche Graz"" ended.[10] The slide is constructed out of large tubular metal pieces and winds around the elevator.[11] The slide covers a height difference of 64 meters and is 170 metres long.[10] A ride takes approximately 40 seconds and costs up to €7,80.

    On the top of the mountain is the Kasemattenbühne, a free air concert venue. It is one of the most popular venue locations in Graz and has a retractable roof so that it can be used when the weather is not good.[12][13] 1310 people fit in the venue at the same time.

      Schlossberg

      Enjoy the view from the Schlossberg in Graz in the middle of the old town.

      In the city and on the summit – certainly no contradiction in Graz. The river, unique historic city centre and, right in the middle, a mountain. The Schlossberg hill of Graz is at once a natural spectacle, central recreation area and vantage point. It takes but a short time to ascend and enjoy the beautiful views of Graz and surroundings. The city owes its name to the castle, which was built more than 1000 years ago on this hill. From the Slavonic word Gradec for ‘little castle’ later emerged Graz.

      Details

      The Schlossberg. It attracts people. In springtime by fresh green, the first warm rays of sunshine, in summer by shady trees and open-air performances, in autumn by the blaze of colours, and in winter you can escape to it from dull routine in the city. And all that within a few minutes. Since 1894 the Schlossbergbahn funicular has mastered the gradient of about 60% perfectly - lately with new observation cars. On top of the hill there is much to discover.

      The Bell Tower dating from the 16th century. Inside it - the ""Liesl"", the heaviest bell of Graz. There is the casemate open-air stage in the former cellars of the destroyed main building of the fortress. A cistern, the Türkenbrunnen (Turkish well), 94m deep, and the mighty Stallbastei bastion were all built by Domenico dell'Aglio. He was leading among the architects from Northern Italy who in the mid-16th century erected new city walls in Graz and a 400m-long fortress on Schlossberg. No one could take this fortress. Not even Napoleon. However, after a victory over the Habsburgs in 1809, Napoleon demanded the demolition of the fortress. A huge amount of money paid to the French by the burghers of Graz could prevent the Clock Tower and the Bell Tower from being destroyed. Thirty years later, Baron of Welden transformed the former fortress hill into the romantic park with its southern plants, which it is still today. The c. 260 steps of Schlossbergtreppe lead you downwards. As does the glass lift which terminates in the Schlossberg tunnel system. The latter was built in World War II as an air-raid shelter for the people of Graz.

      Today it houses not only a grotto railway for the little ones but also the ""Dom im Berg"", an event and exhibition hall equipped with state-of-the-art technical infrastructure - and all that in the centre of a rock.

      By the way: According to legend, it was the devil himself who created Schlossberg. He had promised the people of Graz to make their local mountain, the Schöckl, higher. Of course, in exchange for the first soul climbing up heightened Schöckl. When flying over Graz with a huge rock from Africa in his hands, he caught sight of a procession. It was on Easter Sunday. On which he had no power over humans. And therefore he could not win any soul. In (un-)righteous anger Satan threw the rock onto the town. The rock broke in two parts. Today the smaller one is Austein with its Calvary. The bigger one is Schlossberg.

Schlossberg

  1. Graz,
  2. Austria,
  3. Europe

Top choice in Graz


Rising to 473m, Schlossberg is the site of the original fortress where Graz was founded and is marked by the city's most visible icon – the Uhrturm. Its wooded slopes can be reached by a number of bucolic and strenuous paths, but also by lift or Schlossbergbahn funicular. It's a brief walk or take tram 4 or 5 to Schlossplatz/Murinsel for the lift. A fun way of getting back down is on the Schlossberg Slide.

To avoid a walk back late at night, bear in mind that the lift operates from 8am to 12.30am daily, and the funicular from 9am to midnight from Sunday to Wednesday and until 2am from Thursday to Saturday.

      Clock Tower

      But something isn’t quite right here. What is odd about the face of the clock tower of Graz? A faulty city emblem? No way! Anyone taking a longer look will spot it readily; here time has a different priority. Hours count for more than minutes, and justifiably so, because the area beneath the clock tower is magical and, if you turn round and let your gaze wander over the gardens and city, you will also know why.

      Details

      The fortified medieval tower got its present shape around 1560. And its characteristic wooden gallery as a fire station. Three bells are ringing from the Clock Tower. Three coats of arms decorate the walls.

      A tower on this spot of the hill was first mentioned in the 13th century. When the fortress was reconstructed in the middle of the 16th century, the tower was given its present shape. The hands on the huge clockfaces often confuse people. Is the clock out of order? No. The fact that originally there were only long hands for the hours which could be seen from the distance, and that those for the minutes were added only later caused the ""swapping"" of the hands. The clockworks, made by Michael Sylvester Funck in 1712, are still working but have been driven electronically since the middle of the 20th century.

      When there was fire in the city the fire bell informed the fire brigade about it.

      The fire bell (1645) is one of three bells still hanging on the outside of the Clock Tower. The oldest bell of Graz (1385) strikes the hours. The ""Armesünderglocke"" or ""poor wretches bell"" (around 1450) was ringing during executions. In later years it reminded revellers of the curfew, which earned it the title ""Lumpenglocke"" (rogues bell). At three corners of the tower there are coats of arms, formerly decorating gates and walls of the Schlossberg fortress: the Styrian Panther with the crown of the Duchy of Styria on his head (around 1570), the single eagle as the coat of arms of the later Emperor Ferdinand I (1552), and the double eagle with the initial letters of Maria Theresa (2nd half of 18th century).

      In times of war the massive ""Bürgerbastei"" (burghers bastion) bearing the Clock Tower had to be defended by the residents of Graz, hence its name. Today it is a splendour of flowers and quite southern plants. And there are benches. To relax and to enjoy the grand view of the city and beyond.

      By the way: Near the Clock Tower, some steps down the street a dog of stone is keeping watch. According to a legend, it was a dog's barking which in 1481 saved the emperor's daughter Kunigunde from being kidnapped by the Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus, whose marriage proposal had been rejected.

Graz


This clock tower perched on the southern edge of Schlossberg is the city's emblem. Its present form dates back to the 1560s, and it is so beloved that the townsfolk of Graz paid Napoleon a ransom of 2987 florins and 11 farthings to spare it during his 1809 invasion.

      Schlossberg Lift

      Within 30 seconds to the Clock Tower - the Schlossberg lift is a fast and comfortable way to achieve the ascent of Schlossberg hill.

      In the fast lane. An unusual, fast and yet comfortable way to achieve the ascent of Schlossberg hill in Graz is the Schlossberg lift. The altogether aesthetically appealing design of this new lift, set into the very core of the hill, is also particularly practical if you’re in a hurry or not inclined or able to walk. During the ride, the lift’s glass cabins offer a clear view of the illuminated, rock-lined elevator shaft and distant sky above – a mountain view from within.

      Palais Saurau

      Assault from above? A man with a beard, turban and dagger gazes down threateningly, capturing the attention of passers-by. It’s OK, the well-known Turk under the roof decorates one of the finest buildings in the city. On a stroll through Graz it’s always worth taking in Palais Saurau. With its Baroque, richly decorated wrought iron gate, Renaissance arcades in the courtyard and splendidly decorated first-floor halls, the palace invites you to immerse yourself in the history of the Saurau family.

      Details

      In 1566 Pankraz von Windischgrätz erected a large-scale four-wing palais near the then still existing medieval town wall. A narrow alley between the house and the town wall was part of an escape route from the Burg to the fortress on the Schlossberg, which could be used by Archduke Charles II in case of an enemy attack. Since 1630 the building has been owned by the family of Saurau, today Goess-Saurau. In the 18th century the Counts of Saurau were eager to make the palais Baroque. It was especially the state halls which at that time were given their homogenous interior still remarkably complete. Around 1730 the impressive fanlight of the gateway was made. It ranks among the best Baroque wrought-iron works in Styria. On its side towards Schlossberg , the vast inner courtyard is characterized by galleries from the Renaissance period. The paving with small rounded stones from
      the river Mur - lovingly called ""Murnockerln"" (Mur dumplings) by the locals - is typical of Graz.

      Those who did/do not find rest in the stately house could/can retire to the summer house on the slope of Schlossberg. The domed Baroque gem is so secret that it can hardly be spied from any place in Graz.

      But what about the Turk looking out of Palais Saurau? There are lots of legends. This one, for instance: the Turks had taken Graz, except the fortress on the Sc 2000 hlossberg. When a Turkish pasha was having dinner in today's Palais Saurau, a cannon ball shot from Schlossberg hit his plate with the delicious roast. The latter flew out of the window. What else could he do but gaze after it? In his rage, he ordered the withdrawal of the Turks from Graz. As in fact, however, the Turks have never occupied Graz, the story must have been different. Opinions about the original function of the wooden figure with Turkish features are divided. Maybe the Counts of Saurau just followed a fashion which caught on after the great victory over the Turks in 1683, and decorated their house ""alla turca"".

      By the way: It was a member of the Saurau family (though none from Graz), Franz Josef, who in his position as secretary of state wanted to please Emperor Franz with a birthday surprise in 1797. Composer Joseph Haydn and poet Lorenz Haschka wrote an anthem starting off with the words ""Gott erhalte Franz, den Kaiser, unsern guten Kaiser Franz"". Till the collapse of the monarchy in 1918, this ""Kaiserhymne"" was to remain the official anthem of the Hapsburg Empire. The melody is living on in Haydn's ""Kaiserquartett"" - and in the national anthem of Germany.

      Hofbäckerei Edegger-Tax

      In the Hofgasse, you cannot miss a splendid wooden shop-façade – crowned with a gilded doubleheaded eagle. This is the Edegger-Tax bakery, where you can sample exquisite confectionery from the imperial era such as their “Sissibusserl” or “Kaiserzwieback” biscuits.

      Details

      In former 2000 times the Edegger-Tax bakery was located at Sporgasse 15 - near today's Stiegenkirche. It was first mentioned in 1569, though the building probably dated back to the 14th century.

      In 1787 Mathias Tax bought the bakery and in 1880 Franz Tax III moved it to its current location and made it a prestigious bakery. During the visit of Emperor Franz Joseph to Graz in 1883, the bakery supplied the royal court. Due to the quality of its products, the bakery received an Imperial and Royal Warrant of Appointment in 1888. The carved wooden shop portal was made by the carpenter Anton Irschik from Graz in 1896. In 1940s Franz Edegger married Herta Tax and they ran the bakery together. After that, Erich Edegger and his wife Walheide continued the tradition of the bakery. Today the company is run by his son Robert Edegger and his wife Brigitte.

      The product range includes traditional bakery products like ""Sissi-Busserl"" and ""Kaiserzwieback"" biscuits.

      The oldest parish church in Graz was first mentioned in a historical document in 1343. Known chiefly as a church for students, it lies in the historic centre of Graz close up against the southern side of the Schlossberg,concealed behind the heavy walls of a former Augustinian monastery.

      Amongst the superb façades around Hauptplatz main square, the “Luegghaus” on the corner of Sporgasse is particularly striking thanks to its elaborate stucco façade and arcades. The mouths and noses hidden among fruit and flower garlands on the façade will not escape attentive beholders.

      Today, the “Luegghaus” is home to the Swarovski Store in Graz.

      Burg & Double Spiral Staircase

      Separation and reconciliation. Even official architecture can harbour surprises. The Burg in Graz, official headquarter of the regional government, is a real gem. Centuries of reconstruction have yielded interesting elements of the Gothic, Renaissance and Biedermeier eras. Particularly striking is the double spiral staircase, seeming almost like an optical illusion. This “staircase of reconciliation” consists of two opposing spiral stairs, which merge briefly on each floor, part and then rejoin.

      Details

      AEIOU - these are the letters Emperor Frederick III had written on all the things he possessed and on all the buildings he had erected. So, the Burg in Graz is also inscribed ""AEIOU"" on several façades. In 1438 Frederick, then duke of Styria, decided to erect a new residence in Graz. At the same time he built the court church of St. Ägydius, today's cathedral, and even connected it to his - no longer existing - accommodation wing in the Burg. Over decades it was unclear what the letters A.E.I.O.U., which can be found on many historical buildings throughout Austria, stand for. It was only in March 2023 when this A.E.I.O.U. mystery was solved by a German historian: A.E.I.O.U. stands for „Amor Electis Iniustis Ordinor Ultor“. These words are embedded in contemporary writings about Friedrich III and in a longer sentence in Latin: „En, amor electis, iniustis ordinor ultor; Sic Fridericus ego mea iura rego“, basically meaning „Loved by the Chosen, Feared by the Unjust“.

      Frederick's son, Emperor Maximilian I, continued construction work in the Burg. And he left to posterity one of the major Gothic staircases in Europe. A double-spiral staircase - two flights of staircases, running in opposite directions, join for some steps on each floor, separate again, join again... The architectural masterpiece of 1499 has often been interpreted as a symbol of eternity. Graz people call it the ""stairs of reconciliation"". If you go separate ways, you will reunite.

      From 1564 onwards, Archduke Charles II resided in the Burg. And ruled over Inner Austria, an association of territories reaching as far as Istria, Trieste and Gorizia. By holding court in Graz, by patronising artists and by their building initiatives, Charles and his wife, Maria of Bavaria, helped Graz
      to achieve its heyday. The Burg was extended. Apart from Karlstrakt (Charles Wing), also the Registraturtrakt (Records Wing) with its galleries and sgraffito scratchwork decorations was built. On the greens in front of this building, since 1959 several busts have commemorated important Styrians.

      Among them: the Baroque composer Johann Josef Fux, the architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, the inventors Viktor Kaplan (Kaplan water turbine) and August Musger (slow-motion camera), writers and scholars. The so-called ""gallery of honour"" could still be extended by many persons.

      By the way: All the residences of the Habsburgs were called ""Hofburg"". As in Graz an older Burg (castle) was already existing, it was renamed ""Schloss"" (palace). That's how Schlossberg got its name.

Burg

  1. Graz,
  2. Austria,
  3. Europe

Graz


Graz’ 15th-century Burg today houses government offices. At the far end of the courtyard, on the left under the arch, is an ingenious double staircase (1499) – the steps diverge and converge as they spiral. It adjoins Stadtpark, the city’s largest green space.

    Graz Cathedral (German: Grazer Dom), also called St. Giles' Cathedral (German: Dom St. Ägidius), is the cathedral church in the Austrian city of Graz, dedicated to Saint Giles. It is the seat of the bishop of the Steiermark diocese from 1786, called the Diocese of Graz-Seckau.

    The church was built as church of the Court (hofkirche) in 1438-62 by Friederick III in the Gothic architecture[1] and later (1577-1773) officiated by the Jesuits that made some alterations in Baroque style. Nearby is Mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II.[2]

      Cathedral

      Royal-imperial church architecture is crowning the historic city centre. The cathedral is definitely not to be missed on any sightseeing trip round Graz. Don’t be fooled by the relatively restrained exterior. The ""Gottesplagenbild"", an inspiring relic of splendid Gothic fresco painting, is still in excellent condition today. Inside the cathedral, a multitude of ecclesiastical along with general historical treasures is waiting to be discovered.

      Details

      Today's cathedral reminds of the days when Graz was an imperial city. Emperor Frederick III erected the church together with his new residence in Graz. In the course of history, the cathedral saw many changes. Construction work of the court and parish church in late-Gothic style was started in 1438, as Jesuit church it was refurbished in Baroque style in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Since 1786 it has been the cathedral, i.e. the bishop's and main church of the Catholics in Styria.

      The exterior of the cathedral looks very sober today. In the Gothic period, however, the façades were covered with paintings. One fresco has been preserved - the so-called Gottesplagenbild (""God's Plagues""). It refers to a year of horrors Graz suffered in 1480. The town was struck by three plagues which were considered to be God's punishment - locusts, war and the Black Death. The painting has to be seen as a plea to God for forgiveness and reconciliation. The painter Thomas von Villach arranged the Holy Trinity, saints and the hierarchy of angels as well as the three plagues like an impressive drama demonstrating God's wrath and the plea for mercy, all underlined by medieval ""balloons"".

      The interior of the cathedral hormoniously combines Gothic architecture with Baroque furnishing. The frescos in the church date from the times of Emperor Frederick III. Among them: a fragment showing St. Christopher, clearly recognizable as Frederick wearing the Styrian ducal crown.
      The Jesuits, who owned the church for nearly 200 years, had it furnished in magnificent Baroque by the best local and foreign artists. The splendid high altar was designed by Georg Kraxner. But also the pulpit, the choir stalls and the pews are of impressive quality.
      Among the most precious objects in the cathedral are the two reliquaries to the left and the right of the chancel entrance. Originally the chests belonged to Paola Gonzaga. In 1477 she married Leonhard of Gorizia and brought along her bridal chests from her native Mantua to Leonhard's castle Bruck near Lienz in East Tyrol. Inlays in bone and ivory represent a poem by Petrarca - ""I Trionfi"". The artist Andrea Mantegna is assumed to have made them. The couple died without having children. The Jesuits in Graz finally inherited the chests and used them as reliquaries for bones of Christian martyrs.
      The organ of the cathedral was built in 1978. All the 5,354 pipes are played and the 73 stops are pulled out at services and organ concerts.

      By the way: A masterpiece of the original church furnishing has recently returned to Graz, after many years of renovation in Vienna. Due to its quality and size (274x272 cm), Conrad Laib's painting ""Kreuzigung im Gedräng"" (Crucifixion) is regarded as one of the best late-Gothic panel paintings in the German-speaking countries.

Domkirche

  1. Graz,
  2. Austria,
  3. Europe

Graz


The Domkirche dates from the 15th century, and became a cathedral in 1786. The interior combines Gothic and baroque elements, with reticulated vaulting on the ceiling; its highlights are Conrad Laib's panel painting Crucifixion in the Throng (1457) and the faded Gottesplagenbild fresco on the cathedral’s exterior, which dates from 1485. The fresco depicts life in the early 1480s, when Graz was besieged by its triple tragedy of Turkish invasion, the plague and locusts.

When we last visited it was closed for restoration, due to reopen in December 2019.

      Mausoleum

      An imperial place of rest next to the Dom. Turquoise domes stand out against the blue sky above the Mausoleum and, together with the Dom and Katharinenkirche church, define one of the city’s magnificent views. You could almost have been whisked away to the lands to the south, given how this ensemble enchants any visitor with more than just a hint of Florentine flair. Here in Graz, Emperor Ferdinand II had his court artist Giovanni Pietro de Pomis lay out the impressive tomb. 

      Opening hours:
      Tuesday - Sunday, 09.00 am - 05.00 pm
      The mausoleum is closed from November 1st, 2022 to March 31st, 2023!

      Guided tours are also possible in winter by prior arrangement - request via the Diocesan Museum: T +43/316/8041-890

      Details

      The so-called Stadtkrone (""Crown of the Town"") of Graz comprises such important buildings as the Cathedral, the Burg, the Old University and today's Seminary (former Jesuit college). But it is the domescape of the Mausoleum which also visually crowns the city.

      In 1614 Ferdinand commissioned his Italian court painter and architect to erect a mausoleum and an adjacent St. Catherine's Church next to today's Cathedral. It was to become one of the most important buildings of the early 17th century in Austria. The oval dome above the tomb chapel was the first of its kind built outside Italy. The façade of St. Catherine's is composed with rich small details and demonstrates the taste of time at the threshold of Renaissance and Baroque. As a gable statue, St. Catherine of Alexandria is looking to the former Jesuit college opposite, where in 1585 Graz University was founded. After all, St. Catherine is worshipped as the patron saint of universities.

      In 1619 Ferdinand was elected emperor and left Graz for Vienna. Construction work at the Mausoleum came to a standstill. So in 1637 Ferdinand was laid to rest in a half-finished, ""draughty"" tomb. Only his grandson, Emperor Leopold I, commissioned a young Graz artist to make the interior. The young artist later on became the famous Austrian Baroque architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach.

      The vault is dominated by an impressive sarcophagus of red marble. It is the final resting place of Ferdinand's mother, Maria of Bavaria. Just a plain tablet on the wall indicates the grave of Emperor Ferdinand.

      By the way: An interesting painting in the barrel vault of St. Catherine's illustrates the relief of Vienna from the Turks in 1683. Up in the skies, Emperor Leopold I is glorified as the great defeater of the unbelievers. Though he had fled from the Turks to Passau in time and had returned to Vienna only after their retreat...

Mausoleum of Ferdinand II

  1. Graz,
  2. Austria,
  3. Europe

Graz


The mannerist-baroque Mausoleum of Ferdinand II was designed by Italian architect Pietro de Pomis and begun in 1614; after Pomis’ death the mausoleum was completed by Pietro Valnegro, while Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach chipped in with the exuberant stuccowork and frescoes inside. Ferdinand (1578–1637), his wife and his son are interred in the crypt.

Another highlight is a red-marble sarcophagus of Ferdinand’s parents, Karl II (1540–90) and Maria of Bavaria (1551–1608). Only Maria occupies the sarcophagus – Karl II lies in the Benedictine Abbey in Seckau.

When we last visited the situation was in flux and you could only visit the mausoleum by calling in advance and arranging a time. Call, check the website or ask at the tourist office for the latest on this.

      Priests' Seminary

      Study, discipline, entertainment. With its linear architecture, the Priesterseminar makes its purpose clear. In the spacious inner courtyard you can feel the presence of history and it is understandable why the building was used entirely for educational purposes following the dissolution of the Jesuit order – it housed a school, barracks and even a prison. Today it serves the Catholic Church once again, with the interior courtyard sometimes hosting lively theatre and concert events in Graz.

      Details

      In the second half of the 16th century Styria was mainly Protestant. The Catholic prince, Archduke Charles II, relied on the support of the noblemen to fight the Ottoman Turks. Which lead to religious tolerance. When the noblemen founded a Protestant school, Charles was forced to take countermeasures at least in the field of education. In 1572 he called the Jesuit Order to Graz who immediately took up teaching and started to build a college. In 1585 the Jesuit university was founded. In 1600 Protestant burghers were expelled by Archduke Ferdinand. For 200 years the Jesuits controlled religious and educational life in Graz.

      Up to the 19th century the college, erected by Vinzenz de Ver 2000 da, was connected to the Jesuit church, today's cathedral. While the courtyard covering 1,300m² is characterized by its original Renaissance style, the interior features Baroque jewels. For instance, the so-called Prunkstiege (grand staircase) - a quite narrow, originally humble staircase which was exuberantly decorated with stucco and paintings with banderols in c. 1712.

      The building adjacent to the Seminary is the Old University. It was opened in 1609 by Archduke Ferdinand (later Emperor Ferdinand II). The coats of arms of Ferdinand and his Bavarian wife still embellish the building. On the ground floor there were lecture rooms, above them an aula and a theatre which under Empress Maria Theresa was converted into a huge library in the Rococo style.

      By the way: This can be considered to be a sign of reconciliation: in the building of the former Jesuit college, the stronghold of Catholicism, in 1792 the first Protestant service in Graz after the enactment of the Edict of Tolerance was held.

      Glockenspiel

      Come dance with me! The Glockenspiel in the eponymous square in Graz leads the way. A sweet maiden and hearty lad clad in traditional costume pirouette three times a day (11 am, 3 pm & 6 pm) up in the gable of the building on Glockenspielplatz square. The mechanism’s cheerful 24 bells play three different melodies. A charming, romantic show beyond compare. Enchanted and each with a spring in their step and a smile on their face, lucky viewers head off once the last note dies away.

      In 1884 the spirits producer Gottfried Maurer bought a house in then ""Fliegenplatzl"" square. On his journeys to North Germany and Belgium the businessman got to know carillons and had one installed in his house in Graz. On Chrismas Eve in 1905, the 24 bells in the iron roof turrent chimed for the first time. In 1929 Gottfried Maurer bequeathed the carillon to the city of Graz, conditional on its continued existence. In World War II the bells stopped chiming. They were used for making arms and were renewed only in 1956.

      So the Graz carillon plays its three melodies again, three times a day. But they are not always the same. As the positions of the 800 steel pins on the barrel can be changed. Five times a year you can hear new melodies. Alpine folk and yodelling songs alternate with Christmas carols and pleasant melodies by contemporary composers. But always the arcaded windows in the gable open to show a dancing couple in traditional Styrian costumes. The crowing culmination of the show is the golden cock raising his wings. It is a copy of the cock Gottfried Maurer saw on the city hall in Munich.

      In his time, Gottfried Maurer was quite a smart advertising strategist. Not only the carillon lured people into his wine shop. The art-nouveau facades of the house and the adjacent building also belonging to the businessman in various subjects of the reliefs and mosaics stimulate the viewer to drink some wine. Even the dancer of the carillon raises his glass to the people.

      That's just suitable for the so-called ""Bermuda triangle"" in which you find the carillon. Many a reveller has got lost there in one of the numerous restaurants, cafés and bars...

      By the way: Since 1998 there has been a second carillon in Graz. Unlike the traditional purely mechanical carillon described above, the bells of Mariahilfer Kirche carillon on the right bank of the river Mur are computer-controlled. Moreover, the organ player can play live music on them via a keyboard.

      Hauptplatz & Town Hall

      The Hauptplatz (main square) and the town hall are the heart of the city. At the centre of the Hauptplatz stands the Archduke Johann fountain.

      In brilliant white the bride steps into the square before Rathaus town hall in a cascade of flowers and rice. Just across, a lively hip-hop show. The market stalls offer juices and sausages with mustard – scenes from the heart of the city, the Hauptplatz of Graz, cradled among magnificent buildings crowned by the town hall of Graz. It’s an impressive backdrop for the city’s colourful bustle and focal point for visitors and residents alike. From here you can reach all of the attractions of Graz in a jiffy.

      Details

      Hauptplatz - Main Square

      In the Middle Ages, Graz was an important centre of commerce and trade, where fairs and weekly markets where held. In the market square only burghers lived, mainly traders. The architecture of the staggered row of houses in the west of Hauptplatz, 2000 interrupted by narrow alleys, is reminiscent of the Middle Ages. Below wooden arcades the traders displayed their goods. Masonry arcades can be seen at the two Luegg Houses. Thanks to its gorgeous stucco facade from the late 17th century, the Luegg at the corner to Sporgasse is an impressive eye-catcher. In this respect it competes with the town hall domininating the southern part of Hauptplatz.

      Since 1878, a monument/fountain has towered above the market stalls luring with hot franks, dairy products, fruit, ice cream, or pumpkin seed oil. The monument is dedicated to the ""Styrian prince"" Archduke Johann (1782-1859). Not without reason was the monument erected in such a prominent position in Graz. Archduke Johann started manifold initiatives which had a lasting positive effect on the development of Styria. The fountain shows the Hapsburg surrounded by four female figures. They symbolize the rivers Mur, Enns, Drava and Sann which flew through Styria in her old boarders.

      In 2002, Hauptplatz was redesigned by Graz architect Markus Pernthaler. The wide empty area in front of the town hall offers room. For various events, for instance, promoting public life in the square. At night, friendly and warm indirect light accentuates the impressive colourful façades of Hauptplatz.

      By the way: As the centre of public life, Hauptplatz - up to the late 18th century - was also of importance for executing sentences in the public. For minor offences, people were pilloried there, were locked up in a cage, or had to ride on a wooden ""donkey"". Even executions took place in Hauptplatz.
      Only people of a higher rank were privileged: they were beheaded inside the town hall...

       

      Rathaus - Town Hall

      The history of the town hall illustrates the constantly growing importance of Austria's second largest city. Around 1550, the city administration moved into a quite humble town hall in Renaissance style in Hauptplatz, which, incidentally, also served as a prison. The building was replaced in 1803 by a new and larger town hall in classical style. In the 19th century, the enormous growth in population and the increasing self-assureness of the citizens led to the construction of today's town hall which was planned by the Viennese architects Wielemans and Reuter. It was completed in 1893. All the houses of the block should have been destroyed to make room for the historicist old-style German building. This goal was not achieved, however. In Herrengasse you still find three narrow houses seemingly jammed in the huge town hall building. Their owners had refused to ""sacrifice"" the houses for the new town hall. Which today can be regarded as a ""solid"" symbol of stubborness allegedly typical of Styrian people.

      The main facade of the town hall was radically simplified in the 20th century. But the statues removed from niches and from the main entrance are currently returning as copies: allegories of the craft, the arts, science, and trade, and major protagonists of Austrian history. Inside, the high-quality interior of the two-storey session hall probably brightens up the work of the city council. A coffered ceiling, a gallery, panellings, even the chandelier and the wall clock of the original late 19th-century furnishing have been preserved.

      Although many romantic locations in Graz have been approved as wedding sites by the city authorities, it is only in the wedding hall of the town hall that - thanks to a webcam - your friends and relatives all over the world can witness the marriage ceremony live.

      By the way: The architecture competition for the building of a new town hall held in 1886 was also joined by the Graz native Georg Hauberrisser the Younger. His project for Graz was not realized. But another town hall brought him fame - the one in Munich.

      Hof des deutschen Ritterordens courtyard

      The Gothic arcaded courtyard of the “Hof des deutschen Ritterordens” is definitely worth a visit. It is paved entirely with “Murnockerl”, the Graz name for the cobblestones smoothed round by the river Mur, which were used as paving material for streets and courtyards.

      The stone portal bearing the cross of the order on the headstone dates back to the first quarter of the 16th century (entrance: Sporgasse 22).

      Painted House & Herzogshof

      A wall-tattoo on Herrengasse street? Sure! On the façade of the Herzoghof building in the centre of Graz, Greek and Roman Gods engage in a rendez-vous. The building was first painted as early as 1600. The Baroque painter Johann Mayer applied the ‘divine’ frescos in 1742, since which time it has been known as the ‘painted house’. If you take a moment to immerse yourself in the images, you enjoy an intense sense of submersion right there in the middle of the urban hustle and bustle.

      Details

      Up to the second half of the 15th century, the Habsburgs carried out their official business as princes of Styria in this house. The manager of the building was released from paying any taxes for putting up the ""prince's chair"".

      Herzogshof was first mentioned in 1360. It was in this house that the Dukes of Styria gave their subjects land in fee. When the Burg in Graz was completed soon after 1450, the new building was used for that ceremony. From the year 1600 onwards, a brother of the then Styrian prince and future emperor Ferdinand II lived in the house. It was at that time that it was first painted. By none other than Ferdinand's court painter and future architect of the Mausoleum, Giovanni Pietro de Pomis.

      The house often changed hands until it passed into the hands of a moneychanger. Franz von Lathurner commissioned the artist Johann Mayer from Vorau to fresco the façade anew. Nothing has remained of de Pomis' original painting.

      In the course of time, the identity of the figures depi 2000 cted on the façade fell into oblivion. Just a few years ago they could be identified as Greco-Roman gods. The bottom zone with the popular gods Bacchus (god of wine), Vulcan (god of craftsmen) and Vesta (goddess of home) is closest to the people. Above them, in the hierarchy of gods and on the façade, are Apollo (god of light), Jupiter (king of gods) and Pluto (god of the underworld). The realm of gods is complemented by Mercury (god of merchants and travellers), Mars (god of war), Minerva (goddess of war and the arts), and Aesculapius (god of medicine) in the top row. Heroes of Greek and Roman mythology are also part of the programme.

      With its frescos covering more than 220m², i.e. the whole façade, Gemaltes Haus is unique in Austria.

      By the way: In 1382 a delegation from Trieste arrived at Herzogshof in Graz. The people of Trieste turned to the Habsburgs for protection - in order to escape an occupation by Venice. Till the end of the First World War, Trieste was to remain part of the Habsburg empire.

    The Styrian Armoury (German: Landeszeughaus), in the Austrian city of Graz, is the world's largest historic armoury and attracts visitors from all over the world.[citation needed] It holds approximately 32,000 pieces of weaponry, tools, suits of armour for battle and ones for parades.[1]

    Between the 15th century and the 18th century, Styria was on the front line of almost continuous conflict with the Ottoman Empire and with rebels in Hungary. In order to defend itself it needed troops and these troops needed equipment. The Styrian Armoury results from the resulting need to store large quantities of armour and weapons, and was built from 1642 - 1645 by a Tyrolean architect called Antonio Solar.[1][2]

    After about 100 years in use, Austrian empress Maria Theresia wanted to close down the armoury, as part of her centralisation of the defence of Austria. Nevertheless, Styria petitioned for the ongoing existence of the armoury for both practical and sentimental reasons. Their petition was accepted and the Armoury was left intact, but largely decommissioned.[2]

    During World War II, the entire contents were moved to safety in three castles in remote parts of Styria, and no losses were recorded. After the end of the war, the objects were brought back into the undamaged original building.[2]

    Armour in the Armory

    The armoury is situated in Graz's Inner City, a few steps from Hauptplatz at Herrengasse Nr. 16. The armoury is open six days a week, closed Mondays, throughout the year. In November, it can only be visited through guided tours.[3]

      Details

      Due to its geographical position south of the Alps, and as the capital of Inner Austria, Graz developed as an important centre of defence against intruding peoples from the east. It was especially the advances of the Ottoman Turks, which from the end of the 15th century forced the Styrian estates to organize defence and to build up their weapons stockpiles. Both native gunsmiths and armourers, and masters from Nuremberg, Augsburg and Innsbruck were commissioned. Starting in 1642, Antonio Solar erected a ""Zeughaus"" (armoury) adjacent to the Landhaus for the increasing store of arms.
      The narrow building is five storeys high and about 50m long. The façade is embellished by two impressively vulptuous Baroque statues by Giovanni Mamolo representing Mars (war god) and Minerva (goddess of war and the arts).

      In the course of reforming military administration, Empress Maria Theresa intended to give up the armoury. But the Styrian estates succeeded in preventing the liquidation and in saving the armoury as a testimony for the braveness of the Styrians in fighting the ""age-old enemy of Christendom"".

      So today the only originally preserved armoury in the world contains about 32,000 exhibits. Historical arms and military equipment dating from the late 15th to the early 19th centuries. More than 3,300 armours and helmets, over 7,800 small arms, c. 5,400 staff weapons, 2,400 swords, sabres and the like - whatever was needed for warfare in former times, you will find it in the armoury.

      Besides the mass of weapons for simple soldiers, the gorgeous armours for the nobility and the entirely preserved horse armour from the early 16th century are especially impressive. The c. 50 heavy guns from the ground floor of the armoury, however, were removed when Napoleon's troops were approaching and later on sold to a bell-founder.

      Today the tourist information of Graz has found a new home on the ground floor of the armoury.

      By the way: When you see such a mass of old iron, you will wonder why all these arms do not get rusty. Apart from professional care, the wooden ceilings, floors and wall panels are responsible for it - wood absorbs moisture.

Landeszeughaus

  1. Graz,
  2. Austria,
  3. Europe

Top choice in Graz


If you have a passion for armour and weapons, you'll especially enjoy the Landeszeughaus, where more than 30,000 pieces of glistening weaponry are housed. The exhibition is one of Graz' most interesting and the largest of its kind in Austria and, by its own account, in the world. Expect to see a range of weapons from the 15th to 18th centuries. Admission from November to March is only on tours, which are held in German (11am, 2pm) and in English (12.30pm).

What's most impressive about the exhibition is less the potential of all these weapons to mame and kill (there are obviously more efficient methods today) but the sheer crafting skills that went into many of them.

      Landhaus Courtyard

      The arcaded inner courtyard of the Landhaus Graz is a masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance and one of the top 10 sights.

      What a perfect place for a party! The inevitable thought if you step into the Landhaushof in Graz. Taking in the Renaissance surroundings of this inviting location immediately conjures up colourful images of people enjoying festivities. Here in the summer, flowers decorate the magnificent arcades and, at Advent, the celebrated ice nativity scene finds a perfect setting. In between, concerts, theatre and indeed all manner of festivities take place in the splendid atmosphere of the Landhaus courtyard.

      A touch of Northern Italy in Herrengasse, right in the centre of Graz? In fact, the Landhaus is reminiscent of some Venice palazzo. In 1557, the Italian architect Domenico dell’Allio started to construct a prestigious building for the Styrian estates. It still is the provincial parliament of Styria.
      Not only the main façade of the building is outstanding. People are especially amazed by the Renaissance-style arcaded courtyard. 

      In the late 15th century the Styrian estates gave up holding their diets at different castles and monasteries, and decided to erect a Landhaus in the capital of Graz. The first little ""office"" was extended in the 16th century by ""welschen"" (Italian) master builders to form the largest building complex in the historic centre of Graz. The main wing in Herrengasse and the splendid courtyard were erected in 1557 by Domenico dell'Aglio. He had come to Graz from Northern Italy as a fortress architect also supervising the reconstruction of the fortress on Schlossberg.

      People often just stand and gape after entering the spacious courtyard of Landhaus for the first time. Arcades on all three floors, copper gargoyles dating from the 16th century, the bronze fountain - a Mannerist masterpiece. Not only locals know that such an ambience makes feasts, concerts, film shows, the Christmas ice crib a tremendous experience.

      The interior of Landhaus is adorned by Baroque furnishings. Landstube (the session hall) is notable for its stucco ceiling by Johann Angelo Formentini with plastic figures and coats of arms, and by the porcelain stoves crowned by heraldic animals - the Austrian eagle, and the Styrian panther. In Rittersaal, the elaborate stucco ceiling shows the signs of the zodiac. Not forgetting Landhaus chapel, built in 1630/31. After the expulsion of the Protestant estates in 1629, its black and gold Jesuit-style altar, the altarpiece showing the Assumption of the Virgin, and the two statues of St. Catherine and St. Barbara symbolize the restoration of Catholicism in Landhaus.

      By the way: Since 1588, so-called ""Rumortafeln"" (rumbling panels) fixed next to the Landhaus gateways have prohibited people in the building from rumbling, pulling out a sword, a dagger or a knife, from scuffling and fighting. They should rather be humble in their words and deeds, otherwise they will be severely punished. As these rules can be read there even today, the members of the provincial parliament holding their sessions in the building surely behave according to them...

      Franciscan Monastery

      The Franciscan Monastery with its church is the oldest monastery in Graz. A visit to the cloister with its rose-covered courtyard is well worthwhile.

      Cobblestones, beautiful buildings, as pretty as a picture. The Franciscan church is in one of the most beautiful and popular locations in Graz. Small, historic shops nestle against the exterior walls of this Gothic church and contribute to the square’s romantic image. Attached to the church is the Franziskanerkloster monastery, where a visit to the cloister, with its rose-covered courtyard, is well worthwhile. A place steeped in tranquillity and peace.

      Details

      Apart from the Clock Tower, the tower of the Franciscan church is probably the most prominent among the traditional Graz landmarks. It belongs to the oldest monastery in town, founded in 1239 as a monastery of the Minorites. In the south-west, next to the town walls, in a strategically important position. So the stately tower, uncommon for beggar's orders, was built in the 17th century as a fortified tower on the orders of the city authorities. Adjacent to the Gothic parish church Mariae Himmelfahrt there is the monastery of the Franciscans. Atmospheric cloisters are open to everybody seeking silence in the heart of the city.

      On entering the Franciscan church Mariae Himmelfahrt, visitors are often touched by the harmonious interplay of Gothic architecture and 20th-century works of art. The high, narrow 14th-century chancel stands up from the comparatively low and wide nave. The chancel was gutted by a bomb in World War II. When it was rebuilt, a new contemporary interior was made by Styrian artists. The church is bathed in spheric light by the stained glass-windows. A simple, seemingly hovering crucifix in grey cast iron dominates the chancel. Since December 2004, the latest work of contemporary art in the Franciscan church strikes a chord with church visitors - the bold organ built by the Potsdam company Schuke.

      The originally Gothic cloisters enclose an idyllic monastery garden. Benches invite to have a rest. Epitaphs on the walls of the cloister inform about the names, professions and life data of the distinguished burghers and noblemen who were buried in this place between the 15th and the 18th centuries. The small and quiet Jacobean chapel in the cloister combines Gothic, Baroque and neo-Gothic elements.

      On the first floor, with its windows showing into the chancel of the church, there is the oratory, where the monks meet for their canonical hours. But everybody is invited to join them for vesper. In an atmospheric room within a room, designed in 2003 by architect Lingenhöhle as a light wooden structure with small coloured glass elements.

      By the way: The quarter between Franciscan monastery and Mur river is also called ""calf district"". There, in the 16th century, the butchers of Graz built their shambles over the river. Cattle was driven to slaughter along the monastery building. Numerous small traders settled immediately at the walls of the monastery. So one can easily imagine that the monks complained to the city authorities about ""all that noise and stench""...

Franziskaner Kirche

  1. Graz,
  2. Austria,
  3. Europe

Graz


This church and monastery was founded by the Franciscan order in 1239. Its 14th-century chancel was rebuilt in a contemporary style after being gutted by an Allied bomb during WWII. The main reason to visit, however, is the serene, silent, rose-filled monastery garden, still surrounded by its original Gothic cloisters.

The monks welcome visitors to join them for vespers.

    View of the Kunsthaus Graz from the Schlossberg
    City overview from Schlossberg with Kunsthaus in the middle

    The Kunsthaus Graz, Grazer Kunsthaus, or Graz Art Museum was built as part of the European Capital of Culture celebrations in 2003 and has since become an architectural landmark in Graz, Austria. Its exhibition program specializes in contemporary art from the 1960s onwards.[1]

    Architecture[edit]

    Kunsthaus Graz was designed by Colin Fournier and Sir Peter Cook. According to The Bartlett School of Architecture at University College London, the Kunsthaus' design sought to be deliberately provocative, innovate museum design by offering a less ""institutional"" approach to organising exhibition spaces and employs new materials and manufacturing techniques.[2] The building is an example of blob architecture, and has a skin made of iridescent blue acrylic panels that also double as photovoltaic panels.[3] Owing to its shape contrasting with its surroundings,[4] it is known in local vernacular as the ""Friendly Alien"".[3] or rather as the black tumor.[citation needed]

    The building incorporates the façade of the Eisernes Haus, a iron-framed structure built in 1848.[5]

    Concept[edit]

    Architecture, design, new media, internet art, film, and photography are united under one roof. Kunsthaus Graz was developed as an institution to stage international exhibitions of multidisciplinary, modern and contemporary art from the 1960s to the present day.[1] It does not collect art, maintains no permanent exhibitions and does not have its own depot.[6] Rather, its exclusive purpose is to present and procure contemporary art productions.[4]

    As founding director, Peter Pakesch was responsible for the orientation and the program of the Kunsthaus between the administration in 2003 and the end of his directorship at the Universalmuseum Joanneum.[7]

    The BIX Façade of the museum represents a singular fusion from architecture and New Media and is based on a concept of the Berliner architects realities:united.[8] BIX, a name which consists of the words ""Big"" and ""pixels"", is the acrylic glass skin of the eastern side of the building, which consists of 930 fluorescent lamps whose brightness can be individually adjusted. Variable at 20 frames per second, the facade can be used as a large screen for films and animations in what is referred to as a ""communicative display skin"".[8]

    The BIX facade concept was entered into the permanent Architecture and Design Collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York in 2011.[9]

    Other[edit]

    On 1 May 2011, the Austrian Postal Service released a postage stamp commemorating the object as part of the Kunsthäuser permanent stamp series.[10]

    To mark the tenth anniversary of the Kunsthaus, Ingo J. Biermann, Fiene Scharp and Kai Miedendorp made a short half-documentary film in and about the building. The film Astronaut's Ark was conceived for the Kultur:Stadt exhibition, which took place from March to June 2013 at the Akademie der Künste (Berlin) and from July to October 2013 at the Kunsthaus Graz.[11]

      Kunsthaus Graz

      Universalmuseum Joanneum

      Wonder, enthusiasm, incredulity. The spectacular architecture of Graz Kunsthaus leaves nobody cold. Whilst it’s not common for existing, traditional urban buildings to sit so perfectly next to breathtaking new architecture, with the setting of this museum of contemporary art in Graz it’s definitely the case. The Kunsthaus floats like a mysterious blue balloon between the roofs of the historic city centre. Named friendly alien by its creators, its fascinating magic draws visitors in.

      Details

      Sometimes dreams come true. As is the case with the dream about a Kunsthaus in Graz. The site was a good choice. The right bank of the river Mur, so far a more or less neglected part of the city. The neighbourhood:
      the Eisernes Haus (Iron House), a nearly forgotten, as hardly visible, formerly bold cast-iron construction built by Graz architect Josef Benedict Withalm in 1848.

      The British architects Peter Cook and Colin Fournier won the Europe-wide competition to revitalize the Eisernes Haus and to extend it to a Kunsthaus (Art House). The biomorphic construction in shape and material consciously contrasts with the surrounding gabled houses and their red-tiled roofs, nevertheless, in great respect, snuggles up to older buildings.

      1,066 acrylic glass elements form the skin of the friendly alien. At night it sends light signals or written messages from its ""BIX façade"" to the other side of the river. It sucks daylight from the north through its ""nozzles"" on top. The ""needle"" is a glazed viewing platform, stretching over Eisernes Haus and Kunsthaus on the eastern façade. Inside the Eisernes Haus there is the museum shop, the Kunsthaus administration and Camera Austria - an institution which in exhibitions and the eponymous magazine has devoted itself to photography.

      The transparent base of the Kunsthaus houses a restaurant and a media lounge. The travelator, a slanted moving belt, draws the visitors into the interior of the alien. Which on its two floors offers quite favourable conditions for different kinds of exhibitions. Even though the Kunsthaus allows itself the luxury of showing exclusively art of the past four decades.

      By the way: Not all of the nozzles are directed towards the north. One of them peers to the east. It brings the Clock Tower, the traditional landmark of Graz into the Kunsthaus - as an exhibit, so to speak.

Kunsthaus Graz

  1. Graz,
  2. Austria,
  3. Europe

Top choice in Graz


Designed by British architects Peter Cook and Colin Fournier, this world-class contemporary-art space is known as the 'friendly alien' by locals. The building is signature Cook, a photovoltaic-skinned sexy biomorphic blob that is at once completely at odds with its pristine historic surroundings but sits rather lyrically within it as well. Exhibitions, which usually change every three to four months, focus on contemporary arts and themes, often on issues relating to current political, social and cultural life.

Tours (€2.50; in English 2pm Sunday, in German 3.30pm Saturday and 11am Sunday) cover not only the exhibitions but also the building. Useful multilingual audio guides cost €2.50.

    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
    This article is about the artificial floating platform in Graz, Austria. For the Croatian region historically known in German by the same name, see Međimurje County.
    The Murinsel
    The interior

    The Murinsel (German, literally Mur island) in Graz, Austria, is an artificial floating ""island"" in the middle of the Mur river and links the two banks on both sides. At night the blue navigation lights that surround the structure light up. This landmark of Graz was designed by New York City artist Vito Acconci on the occasion of Graz becoming the 2003 European Capital of Culture.[1][2]

    Described by the artist as ""A bowl that morphs into a dome that morphs into a bowl…""[3] Mur Island is in the form of a giant sea shell and measures 47 m (154 ft) in length. Two footbridges connect it with both banks of the Mur. The center of the platform forms an amphitheatre. Below a twisted round dome there is a café and a playground.[1]

      Island in the Mur

      Island or boat? It isn’t easy to tell with this extravagant steel construction by US-American artist Vito Acconci. The Island in the Mur was commissioned as part of the city’s role as Capital of Culture in 2003. What is clear is its function as a link between river and city, a wonderful place to drink coffee or enjoy a cocktail. With the river Mur swirling cheerfully by on both left and right sides, from the Murinsel you can appreciate a completely new perspective of the city of Graz.

      Details

      The island has brought the river Mur back to the people of Graz. Up to a few years ago, the river had been polluted by sewage water and industrial effluent. So the fact that the Mur had dug itself 12m deeper into its riverbed after its regulation in the 19th century hardly bothered people. Now the river connecting and dividing the city has a good quality of water again, has become inviting.

      Graz as ""Cultural Capital of Europe 2003"" - an impetus to a fresh start.

      Graz-born Robert Punkenhofer inspired the New York artist Vito Acconci to design an accessible artificial island. The project was realized as a 47m-long reticular steel construction. The curved and twisted shape can be associated with a half-opened shell. In its open part, wave-like blue benches form an amphitheatre for events of all kinds. Under the domed glass roof cooled by water, a café in blue and white offers the opportunity to enjoy being close to Mur - a new feeling even for locals. Between the café and the amphitheatre a three-dimensional maze made of ropes, and a slide are promising an ""island adventure"" for children.

      What is called an island, is a ship in fact. She is held by an anchor and is stabilized additionally by the two footbridges connecting her to the river banks. She has even got navigation lights. As a warning to other ships possibly straying into Mur. But as it is shining in bright blue at night, the Mur Island cannot and will not be overlooked anyway.

      By the way: After the ""Cultural Capital"" year the island would have been sold to another city on another river. However, the locals have fallen in love with it and so it will stay anchored in the river. Probably for the next 50 years. And a once-in-a-century flood will not distroy it. That's what analyses made by the Graz University of Technology promise us.

Murinsel

  1. Graz,
  2. Austria,
  3. Europe

Graz


Murinsel is a constructed island-cum-bridge of metal and plastic in the middle of the Mur. This modern floating landmark contains a cafe, a kids' playground and a small stage. Even if you don't stop in, it's a great little detour that brings you up close to the fast-flowing river.

    Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) in Graz, is the most significant Baroque palace complex in the Austrian province of Styria.[1] With its preserved accouterments, the extensive scenic gardens, as well as some special collections from the Universalmuseum Joanneum housed in the palace and surrounding park, Schloss Eggenberg ranks among the most valuable cultural treasures of Austria. Eggenberg Palace is situated at an elevation of 381 meters on the Western edge of the city.[2] Its architectural design and the still visible imprint of centuries of history continue to bear witness to the vicissitude and patronage of the one-time mightiest dynasty in Styria, the House of Eggenberg.

    In 2010, the significance of Schloss Eggenberg was recognised with an expansion to the listing of the Graz Historic Old Town among the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Sites.

    Surrounded by walls, with a huge portal facing West, the palace is located in the Eggenberg district of Graz and can be reached by tram. The northern corner of the palace grounds features the Planetary Garden and Lapidarium of Roman stonework as well as the entrance to the new Archeology Museum,[1] which houses the Cult Wagon of Strettweg. At ground level, the palace houses a numismatic collection (Coin Cabinet)[3] located in the former rooms of Balthasar Eggenberger, owner of the imperial minting license and operations in the Late Middle Ages. On the upper level, the Alte Galerie[4] encompasses a large array of paintings, sculptures, and other works of art from the medieval era through the early modern period, spanning five centuries of European art history.

    History[edit]

    Construction[edit]

    Schloss Eggenberg, Graz, Austria
    Eggenberg Palace (2019)

    At first glance, Schloss Eggenberg presents itself as a uniform, new construction of the 17th century. Nevertheless, large portions of the building date back to the Late Middle Ages and construction continued throughout the early modern era.

    Before 1460 Balthasar Eggenberger, financier to Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, bought property in the west of Graz which became a fixed noble residence in the family name. In the subsequent years the family residence was constructed and expanded. By 1470, a square Gothic chapel had been constructed in the tower. A Papal indulgence from 30 May 1470 refers to the ""Capella Beate Marie Virginis Sita in Castro Eckenperg"", the Chapel of the Virgin Mary in Eggenberg Castle, which became the nucleus of the new palace built by Balthasar's great-grandson, Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg.[5]

    The younger cousin of General Ruprecht von Eggenberg, Hans Ulrich, as a superb diplomat and statesman, steered the foreign policy of his Emperor, Ferdinand II,[6][7] while Eggenberg's counterpart and political adversary, Cardinal Richelieu of France, guided that of King Louis XIII[8][9] during Thirty Years War. As prime minister (in contemporary political jargon)[10] and close, personal confidant of Ferdinand II, Hans Ulrich wanted a grandiose residence representing his new status and authority when he was named ""Gubernator"" (Governor) of Inner Austria after the emperor chose Vienna as his imperial capital.[11] In 1625 Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg commissioned court architect Giovanni Pietro de Pomis with the planning of his new palace, inspired by El Escorial in Spain.[12] As an architect, painter, and medailleur (designer and minter of medals), de Pomis, originally from Lodi near Milan, became the most important artist at the Grazer court.[13] Incorporating the original medieval family residence into the new palace, de Pomis himself oversaw the construction work up to his death in 1631. Fortress master builder Laurenz van de Syppe continued the work for two years until the building was finished, in the end, by both of de Pomis' site foremen, Pietro Valnegro and Antonio Pozzo. The shell appears to have been completed by 1635 or 1636. Between 1641 and 1646 work on the ornamentation was brought to a close.

    In 1666, Johann Seyfried von Eggenberg, grandson of Hans Ulrich, began to develop the palace according to the splendor and grandeur of the Baroque style and in 1673 the residence again entered the limelight as Archduchess Claudia Felicitas of Tyrol was a guest in the palace on the occasion of her wedding in Graz to Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor.[14] Under Prince Johann Seyfried, the comprehensive cycle of ceiling coverings of approximately 600 paintings in the rooms of the piano nobile was accomplished in just 7 years. Hans Adam Weissenkircher began his service as the court painter of the princely Eggenberger court in 1678. He finished the painting cycle of the main festival hall, the famous Planetary Room, in 1684/85. With this, the first phase of accouterment work on Schloss Eggenberg was completed.

    After the extinction of the male line of the Eggenberg family, the Eggenberger state rooms were left in a half-emptied and neglected state. The husband of the last Eggenberger princess, Johann Leopold Count Herberstein, ordered a comprehensive renewal of the complex.[15] Between 1754 and 1762 the building and the garden underwent their second major phase of ornamentation, this time in complete accordance with the tastes of the Rococo. Above all, the accouterment of the piano nobile was modernized. Nevertheless, the Planetary Room and the entire cycle of ceiling paintings remained almost unchanged. Thus, the works limited themselves to wall decorations, stoves and pieces of furniture. In keeping with the taste of the times, three East Asian cabinets were introduced and the state rooms received new wall coverings. The most extensive change was probably the demolition of the Eggenberger palace theater, in the place of which a baroque palace church was established. The supervisor of these works was the Grazer court architect Joseph Hueber, a student of Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt.

    The third phase of the changes came during the 19th century and was limited to the living quarters on the 1st storey (2nd floor in American English) of the palace. The piano nobile remained untouched and unused for a full century. The primary focus of attention of this period was the total transformation of the Baroque formal garden into a romantic landscape garden after the English fashion.

    The entire complex remained in the possession of the Herberstein family up to 1939. Shortly before the war, Schloss Eggenberg was acquired with the park by the state of Styria. The oldest museum in Austria, the Joanneum, which was established on 26 November 1811 by Archduke Johann of Austria, took over management of the palace and park. The Joanneum conducted extensive restoration work to repair the damage that occurred during World War II and the subsequent occupation by the Allies and in 1953 Schloss Eggenberg and the Eggenberg Schloss Park were finally opened again to the public.

    Scheme[edit]

    With his new residence, Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg, the mental inspiration behind the complex program, realized an architectural concept deeply influenced by the humanist notions of magic as the praxis of natural philosophy and of the rational order of the world. Above all, astronomy, astrology and alchemy were major components of the education of a worldly prince. In addition to representing the prince's new rank, all these aspects flowed into the vision of the new building as a symbol of the cosmos as a well-organized, hierarchical, logico-mathematically explicable system.

    Schloss Eggenberg relies on the Gregorian calendar as a basis for this constructed universe. The palace has 365 exterior windows, one for each day of the year. Of these, 52 are on the 24 rooms of the piano nobile representing the weeks of one year. The 2nd storey contains these 24 state rooms in a ring-shaped arrangement which symbolize the hours in a single day. Every floor in the building bares exactly 31 rooms counting the maximum number of days in a calendar month. The 52 windows of the piano nobile with the 8 windows of the Planetary Room make a total of 60, representing both the number of seconds in a minute and the minutes in an hour.

    The palace is erected on a rectangular plan with the geometrical center being formed by the middle tower with its Gothic chapel. On each corner there is a tower-like rise. Each of these corner-towers represents one of the four seasons and the outside corner of each is aimed exactly in a cardinal direction.

    Planetary Room[edit]

    The cycle of 24 state rooms culminates in the main festival hall, the Planetary Room and serves as both the beginning and the end of the ring of state rooms. The cycle of the oil paintings in this hall was created by Hans Adam Weissenkircher and displays the four elements, the 12 signs of the Western zodiac and of course the seven classical ""planets"" (planetes asteres: wandering stars) known to Antiquity. The cycle of paintings by Weissenkircher melds the architectural program with the ornamentation of the palace thereby achieving an allegory of the ""Golden Age"" ruled over by the House of Eggenberg.

    Piano nobile[edit]

    The cycle of some 600 ceiling paintings in the 24 state rooms of the piano nobile recalls the history of the world with scenes from Greek and Roman mythology, religious scenes from the Old Testament, and historical legends from Western Europe. This ceiling program with its stucco framing dates back to the first period of accouterment in the 17th century.

    Under the married couple Eggenberg-Herberstein, the 24 rooms of the piano nobile were refurbished according to the tastes of the Rococo starting in the mid-18th century. In addition to new pieces of furniture, chandeliers and sconces, and high-quality faïence stoves, nearly all the rooms also received brand-new, monochrome silk damask wall coverings. Five rooms in the north tract of the piano nobile were equipped with large painted canvasses. Styrian artist Johann Anton Baptist Raunacher dedicated each room to a different subject; shepherd's games, theatrical scenes and gambling scenes are found alongside society scenes and hunting scenes in Schloss Eggenberg. It was during this phase that the Eggenberg palace theater was converted into a palace church in the Baroque style. In addition, three exquisite East Asian cabinets were integrated into the sequence of rooms. The first two are adorned with valuable Imari porcelain plates and bowls as well as Chinese silk paintings. In the wall coverings of the third cabinet, eight panels of a precious Japanese folding screen have been used. These traditional dividers portray the palace and the fortified town of Osaka before 1615, whereby it can be determined that these panels were executed shortly thereafter. From the early modern era there are very few of these screens depicting the city before its destruction, so these works are especially noteworthy. On account of the viewpoint on Osaka the Eggenberg panels represent a unique exhibit.[16]

    Gardens[edit]

    Schloss Eggenberg, water feature in the English garden

    The various owners and builder-owners have always looked at the palace and at the surrounding gardens as corresponding elements. Thus, every succeeding generation has carried out significant alterations.

    The largest expansion of the garden occurred after the completion of the house. In the last third of the 17th century the garden was generously extended around the building. It followed the pattern of the strictly subdivided Italian garden, with parterres, bosquet areas, fountains, aviaries and pheasant gardens.

    Johann Leopold Count Herberstein allowed the whole arrangement to be reshaped into a French garden. As early as the 1770s, the Eggenberg Gardens were an attraction open to the Grazer public.

    However, with the advent of the Enlightenment and the liberalization of ideas under Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, by the end of the 18th century, it was thought that Baroque gardens were ugly; having a pruned nature constricted by too stringent norms. Jérôme Count Herberstein, as a fanatical garden lover, partook of this perspective and in 1802 prompted the stylish transformation of the Eggenberg Schloss Park into a picturesque English garden.[17] labyrinths, fountains, straight paths and hierarchical patterns all had to give way to the call to ""return to nature"" in the sense of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Apart from the straight entrance way, which was preserved, the goal was to create artificial vistas with the new, winding pathways and the illusion of being in an Arcadian landscape painting such as those of Claude Lorraine[18] whose works inspired the likes of Stourhead as well as many others. The recently restored Rose Mound formed the climax of this 19th-century landscape park.

    The early 20th century saw a dwindling of interest in the palace gardens and the Eggenberg Schloss Park no longer employed a gardener. This had the unfortunate consequences of individual elements of the garden being torn-out and, over the course of decades, the rest being overgrown; the entire arrangement thus becoming more or less a simple city park.

    In 1993, in cooperation with the Austrian Federal Bureau of Cultural Heritage Management (Bundesdenkmalamt), a garden grooming project was begun with the goals of preserving and reconstructing the gardens as a cultural monument to Romanticism. The still existing elements were to be made recognizable and protected and the lost elements reconstructed in so far as it was possible. The initial phases of this project that have already been completed are the reconstruction of the 1848 Breakfast Garden behind the palace and the reclamation and restoration, which occurred during the winter months of 2007/08, of the Rose Mound, one of the most important components of the romantic English landscape garden.

    Additionally, the peacocks from the Graz Peacock Garden formerly located between the inner city and the city park have found a new home in the Eggenberg Schloss Park. The species are of both the white variety and the more common Indian blue peacock. During mating season, the loud cawing of the males as well as their brilliant plumage adds an exotic flair to the splendor of the park as they try to attract the larger but less colorful females.

    Planetary Garden[edit]

    In the north corner of the grounds, an enclosed, separate garden went through such diverse transformations and uses over the course of the palace history that in the end it was discernible only by the spatial structure.

    Due to a lack of surviving records, a new design for the flower garden was decided on in 2000 and a new garden grew out of an old idea. Landscape architect Helga Tornquist took up the theme of the Eggenberg scheme and incorporated it into a contemporary garden creation. This reclamation takes up in a playful fashion the ancient system of planetary ""signatures"", which is of special significance for the iconography of Schloss Eggenberg.[19] The Lapidarium has been established over the foundations of the former orangery as a point of interest and to provide an appropriate setting for the Roman Stonework Collection of the Joanneum.

    Schloss Eggenberg enters the 21st century with the opening of a newly constructed subterranean showroom adjoined to the Lapidarium to house the Joanneum's Pre- and Early History archaeological Collections in autumn of 2009 to be ready for the Joanneum's bicentennial celebration in 2011.

    Commemorative silver euro coin[edit]

    In 2002, the Austrian Mint honored the importance of Schloss Eggenberg, by using it as the main motif of one of its most popular silver euro commemorative coins: the 10 euro Eggenberg Palace commemorative coin. The reverse side shows an image of Johannes Kepler, a personal acquaintance of Eggenberg's[20] who taught at the former Protestant school in Graz. His first major work, Mysterium Cosmographicum describing the Copernican system, written while he was still in Graz, likely influenced the symbolism of the design of the palace.[20]

      Eggenberg Palace

      Universalmuseum Joanneum

      The universe is in Graz! It’s no joke, but rather a wonderful example of harmonious architectural skill: Eggenberg Palace on the edge of the city centre. Set within a beautiful park is the main palace, which was laid out as an architectural allegory of the universe. The building represents a precisely calculated cosmos. It was commissioned by Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg from the year 1625 to embody his wish for a harmonious structure, reacting to the chaos of the 16th century.

      Details

      365 windows, 31 rooms on each floor, 24 state rooms with 52 doors and, in all, 60 windows, 4 corner towers - all allusions to time, to the seasons, to weeks, days, hours, minutes. This number symbolism based on the then new Gregorian calendar is the architectural programme of the palace. Also the paintings in the Planetensaal (Planet Hall), whose decoration was started in 1678, are characterized by astronomical symbolism. In the canvases on the ceiling, the painter, Hans Adam Weissenkircher allocated the seven celestial bodies known at his time to the days of the week, to Roman gods, to metals and to members of the Eggenberger family, among them after all a victorious general and an imperial envoy. On the walls the twelve signs of the zodiac complete the astronomical play on numbers.
      Only recent research has shown that Hans Ulrich incorporated the medieval castle of the Eggenberger family into the new palace. The intersection of any diagonals drawn through the building is the old Gothic chapel. In the mid-18th century, the heirs of the Eggenberger family, the Counts of Herberstein, turned the former theatre of the palace into a splendid Baroque church. Therefore, the old chapel was no longer used, and its original function fell into oblivion. The winged altar from 1470 was reduced to its 13 panels which were framed and sold to America in the early 20th century. Just a few years ago, the altar was rediscovered and returned to its original place.

      Schloss Eggenberg is inseparably bound up with its park which has changed with the taste of the times. In the mid-19th century, it was converted into the landscape garden of the present. A special attraction are the majestically stalking peacocks. And a refashioned space of the park - the Planetengarten. Of course, it continues the iconography of the palace.

      Today Schloss Eggenberg is managed by the Joanneum, the Provincial Museum of Styria. Important collections invite to a visit: the Lapidarium with one of the largest collection of Roman stones in Austria, the prehistory and early history departments, the coin collection and, opening in summer 2005, the Alte Galerie - works of art from the Romanesque period to late Baroque.

      By the way: The great history of the Eggenberger family was terminated by an appendicitis in 1717. Only four years after his grandfather's and one year after his father's deaths, Johann Christian II von Eggenberg died at the tender age of 13. With the last male member of the family the dynasty of the Eggenberger died out.

Schloss Eggenberg

  1. Graz,
  2. Austria,
  3. Europe

Top choice in Graz


Graz' elegant palace was created for the Eggenberg dynasty in 1625 by Giovanni Pietro de Pomis (1565–1633) at the request of Johann Ulrich (1568–1634). Admission is via a highly worthwhile guided tour during which you learn about the idiosyncrasies of each room, the stories told by the frescoes and about the Eggenberg family itself.

Johann Ulrich rose from ordinariness to become governor of Inner Austria in 1625, at a time when Inner Austria was a powerful province that included Styria, Carinthia, and parts of Slovenia and northern Italy. His baroque palace was built on a Gothic predecessor (which explains an interesting Gothic chapel in one section of the palace, viewed from a glass cube) and has numerous features of the Italian Renaissance, such as the magnificent courtyard arcades.

The guided tour (available in English or German) takes you through the 24 Prunkräume (staterooms), which, like everything else in the palace and gardens, are based on astronomy, the zodiac, and classical or religious mythology. The tour either ends or starts at the Planet Hall, which is a riot of white stuccowork and baroque frescoes. The ticket for the tour (State Room Ticket) also allows you to visit the Schloss Eggenberg Museums and the rest of the 18 Joanneum museums within a 24-hour period from the time of purchase.

Schloss Eggenberg Museums

  1. Graz,
  2. Austria,
  3. Europe

Graz


Graz' Schloss Eggenberg and park grounds are home to an ensemble of excellent museums, including the Alte Galerie (Old Gallery), with its outstanding collection of paintings from the Middle Ages to the baroque. Also very worthwhile are the Archaeological Museum housing relics from prehistory to classical times, and the Coin Collection.

Just a few of the highlights in the Alte Galerie are works by Lucas Cranach the Elder, Martin Johann Schmidt and Pieter Brueghel the Younger. In a clever touch, each room has been individually coloured to highlight and complement the dominant tones of the paintings displayed in them. While the Coin Collection is more of eclectic interest (magnifying glasses on the case help to see the coins close up), the Archaeological Museum houses the exceptional Strettweg Chariot and a bronze mask, both dating from the 7th century BC, as well as a collection of Roman finds in the province.

Schloss Eggenberg Parkland

  1. Graz,
  2. Austria,
  3. Europe

Graz


Lending Graz' Schloss Eggenberg broad splashes of green, these palace gardens are a relaxing place for whiling away the time amid squawking peacocks and deer that roam among Roman stone reliefs. It includes the Planetengarten (Planet Garden) based on the same Renaissance theme of planets you find inside the palace itself.

The Planetengarten was created in the late 1990s as a celebration of the role astrology has played in the lives of people in the Western world. With its symmetries and carefully tended walkways, it creates a relaxing atmosphere for thought and meditation. Admission to the garden is included with entry to the parkland.

    Builtbefore 1042
    Demolishedstruck by lightning on 10 July 1723

    Gösting Castle (German: Burg Gösting) is a ruined castle in Gösting, the 13th borough in the northwest of the Styrian capital Graz, Austria.

    Location[edit]

    Due to its good strategic location, the castle controlled the narrow Mura valley north of Graz, which opens out into the Graz basin, and therefore the traffic and trade to and from Graz. The castle ruin, which is 200 metres (660 ft) above Graz, is a popular place to visit, since it offers a panoramic view of the Graz basin and the eastern Styrian hill country even today.

    History[edit]

    The castle was built in the 11th century; the first record dates to the year 1042. It continued to be extended until the 15th century. In that century, the castle was expanded to a fortress to provide protection against the Turks and Hungarians. It was part of the signalling fire system, which was supposed to warn the population in case of danger.

    In 1707, the castle and domain were acquired by the Counts of Attems. On 10 July 1723 lightning struck the gunpowder magazine and a large part of the castle burnt down. It was not rebuilt, but was replaced as the new residence of the Attems family by the Baroque Schloss Gösting or Neugösting at the foot of the mountain, which was completed in 1728.

    Since 1999 the ruin and surrounding forests have been owned by the Auer family, who are bakers.[1] The ruin is maintained by the castle foundation, which was founded in 1925.

    Construction[edit]

    Today only the chapel, the keep, and the remains of some of the walls are still standing. The tower now houses a small museum, and a tavern has been established. The castle can be reached on foot in only 30 minutes from the Schlossplatz in Gösting.

      Gösting Castle Ruins

      Despairing maidens and precipitous views. The ruins of Gösting castle offer the perfect destination for a trek within easy reach of the city. The steep but short ascent passes by the ‘Jungfernsprung’, the place from which, legend has it, the lovesick and grief-stricken Anna von Gösting threw herself to her doom. Further up, by the castle ruins, there are impressive views of  the strategically important valley of the river Mur, Graz itself and the landscape around Gösting.

      Unfortunately, the castle tavern and access to the castle ruins will remain permanently closed until further notice!

    The Baroque Mariatrost Basilica on top of the Purberg hill in Mariatrost, a district of Graz, is one of the most famous pilgrimage sites of Styria in Austria.[1]

    The pilgrimage church stands prominently on top of the Purberg hill (469 m) in the northeast of Graz. It can be reached using the 200 or more steps of the Angelus stair. The basilica is classified as a Baroque building. Two front towers (61 m) and a dome, visible from a great distance, are the characteristic attributes of the church, which is enclosed by two projecting wings of a former monastery once occupied by the Pauline Fathers (1708–86) and later by the Franciscans (1842–1996).[1]

    The building was begun in 1714 by Andreas Stengg and his son Johann Georg Stengg and finished in 1724. The pulpit by Veit Königer (1730/31) is the masterpiece of the furnishings. The frescoes on the ceiling by Lukas von Schram and Johann Baptist Scheidt are of particular importance.[1]

    The main altar includes a statue of the Madonna originally created in the Gothic period around 1465, but altered to the Baroque style in 1695 by Bernhard Echter.[2]

    Father David Bauer, a Canadian ice hockey coach and Basilian priest, attracted a following while coaching in Austria and conducted mass on several occasions at the basilica.[3]

    On 28 October 1999 the church was nominated as a basilica minor.[2]

    The Mariatrost Basilica is the second most important Marian shrine of Styria after Mariazell Basilica.[2]

      Mariatrost Basilica

      The double-towered pilgrimage church and basilica Mariatrost sits on top of a hill on the eastern edge of Graz.

      To travel hopefully… and arrive in Mariatrost. Located on Purberg hill in Graz, this church is one of the best-known pilgrimage destinations in Styria. Many pilgrims from all over Europe converge here to ascend the 216 steps to the basilica that towers gloriously toward the heavens. The holy shrine to the Virgin Mary in the heart of this Baroque-style church isn’t the only attraction. Beautiful frescos and the impressive pulpit also await you at the magnificent, twin-spired Mariatrost Basilica. The twin-towered pilgrimage church stands proudly on a hill in the east of Graz. In 1714, the order of St. Paul commissioned (most probably) the architects Andreas and Johann Georg Stengg to erect the church.

      More than 200 steps lead up Purberg to the major shrine of the Virgin Mariy in Graz - the pilgrimage church of Mariatrost. A curved Baroque façade and two huge towers flanked by the wings of a monastery in which - intermittently - up to the year 1996 monks were living.

      Details

      Through the lantern in the dome, skylight gets into the church and brightens up the high altar with the late-Gothic madonna. The dress is Baroque. As is the altar itself. The grey marble was quarried immediately on Purberg. The marble side altars with thier impressive intarsia were donated by Styrian noble families.

      The interior is characterized especially by the frescos painted by Lukas von Schram and Johann Baptist Scheidt. They glorify the Virgin Mary, also as a ""helper on the road to victory"". Which is underlined by a scene showing the Battle of Lepanto in which the Turks were defeated.

      A gem of the church's furnishing is the pulpit. It was created by Veit Königer in 1779. The statue in the highest position on the canopy symbolizes faith. Expressive figures are reaching out for it, seeking help in the cross. Hope with an anchor and Charity with a heart represented on the pulpit itself complete the three Christian virtues.

      In 1999 the pilgrimage church of Mariatrost was bestowed with the title Basilica by Pope John Paul II.

      +++ By the way +++
      Numerous legends have grown up around the founding of the shrine. Here's the most famous of them: Johann Maximilian von Wilferstorff, who owned a castle on Purberg, was given a Gothic, obviously not very precious madonna for his chapel by the monks of Rein Abbey. When the nobleman's daughter came down with a bad disease, she started praying for recovery to the madonna. Her prayers were answered, and the news of the miracle spread like wildfire. Mariatrost became a shrine attracting pilgrims seeking comfort and help even from Hungary and Croatia. So what difference does it make that Johann Maximilian von Wilferstorff supposedly did not have a daughter at all.
